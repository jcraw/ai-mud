        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You step through a crumbling stone archway, its jagged edges whispering stories of long-forgotten prisoners. Moss clings stubbornly to the damp walls, giving the space a ghostly green hue, while flickering torchlight dances erratically, illuminating the ancient runes carved deep into the doorframe. The musty air wraps around you like a shroud, heavy with the scent of mildew and echoes from the darkness, hinting at the secrets that lie ahead.

        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a dark corridor, where the narrow stone passage constricts your movements, giving a sense of confinement. Each step you take causes your footsteps to echo ominously, reverberating through the gloom like a distant warning. The rhythmic sound of dripping water punctuates the silence, its source hidden in the shadows, while spider webs cling in the corners, their silken threads glistening faintly in the dim light. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet is cold and uneven, a reminder of countless travelers who have ventured through this forsaken place before you.

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You enter the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms at the far end, its grandeur long faded into a testament of neglect. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their colors dulled by time and the encroaching gloom. The cracked marble floor beneath your feet feels frigid, a cold draft swirling around you from unseen passages, as ominous shadows flicker and dance in the flickering torchlight. Slumped upon the throne, a skeleton sits in silent vigil, its hollow gaze a haunting reminder of power lost to the ages.
