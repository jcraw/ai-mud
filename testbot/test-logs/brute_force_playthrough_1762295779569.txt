        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You find yourself at the entrance of a dungeon, where a crumbling stone archway looms overhead, its once-majestic form now a mere whisper of its former glory. Moss-covered walls cling to the stone, their dampness releasing a musty scent that mingles with the flickering torchlight, casting eerie shadows that dance along the surface. Ancient runes carved into the doorframe pulse faintly, hinting at forgotten secrets and the weight of untold stories that linger in the air.

        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, the air growing cooler as the darkness envelops you. Your footsteps echo softly against the worn flagstone floor, a rhythmic reminder of your solitude in this ancient corridor. The sound of dripping water reverberates, creating an unsettling melody that mingles with the faint rustle of spider webs clinging in the corners. Shadows loom larger as flickering torchlight struggles against the oppressive gloom, providing just enough illumination to reveal the secrets hidden in the shadows.

        Player: go west

        Game Master:
        Forgotten Armory
You find yourself in the Forgotten Armory, where rusty weapon racks lean precariously against the walls, their once-proud blades dulled by neglect. Tarnished armor stands, cloaked in dust, silently bear witness to battles long past, their surfaces etched with the stories of valiant knights. The air is thick with the musty smell of old leather and metal, intertwining with the faint scent of decay, while cobwebs blanket the shields that hang like ghostly sentinels from above. Ancient battle standards, tattered and faded, dangle solemnly, whispering remnants of glory in a place where valor has long since faded into silence.
