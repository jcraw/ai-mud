        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a narrow stone passage that seems to stretch endlessly into darkness. The sound of your footsteps echoes ominously off the damp walls, mingling with the persistent drip of water from unseen crevices. In the corners, delicate spider webs cling like ghostly veils, remnants of a world that feels long forgotten. The worn flagstone floor beneath you is cold and uneven, each step a reminder of the passage of time in this forgotten corridor.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step into the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms, its presence both imposing and melancholic. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their once-vibrant colors muted into ghostly echoes of glory past. The cracked marble floor, slick with dust, stretches out beneath you, and an unsettling cold draft whispers through unseen passages, stirring the air with a ghostly chill. In the shadows, a skeleton slumps forlornly on the throne, the remnants of its regal life now draped in a shroud of ominous stillness.
Exits: south, north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You return to the abandoned throne room, where the massive stone throne looms like a sentinel of despair. Faded royal tapestries shudder slightly in the cold draft, their tattered edges brushing against the cracked marble floor, as if the whispers of long-departed nobility still linger in the air. Ominous shadows stretch across the room, creeping closer to the skeleton that slumps upon the throne, a silent witness to the tragic decay of power and glory. The chill that envelops you feels alive, carrying with it the weight of forgotten histories, a spectral reminder of the kingdom that once thrived here.
