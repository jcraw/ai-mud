            **PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)**
- Progress toward leveling up the Dodge skill was non-existent, with no actions resulting in skill advancement (0/10 achieved). This indicates a significant flaw in the game's design where the player cannot find opportunities to engage with hostile NPCs effectively.
- The pacing was abysmally slow, as evidenced by the numerous attempts to navigate the environment without meaningful results. The player spent considerable time exploring, but the lack of encounter opportunities led to stagnation.
- Hardly any progression milestones were achieved, resulting in frustration rather than satisfaction. The player’s actions seemed futile since they never accumulated experience or skill levels.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
  - Ensure that significant areas have accessible NPC encounters to promote skill progression. Create new paths or random enemy spawn points that the player can discover to serve as combat zones.
  - Increase the probability of encountering hostile NPCs in explored areas to reward the exploration efforts consistently.
  - Implement clearer communications on where combat encounters can occur to alleviate the endless cycle of exploration without fruit.

**COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 1/10)**
- There were no combat encounters during the entire playthrough. Consequently, it’s impossible to assess whether the difficulty of fights was appropriate or balanced.
- The player didn't take or deal any damage, indicating a complete absence of engaging combat mechanics.
- Since the player never faced combat, it led to a dull and unchallenging experience.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
  - Introduce low-level enemy NPCs that are more common around the starting areas to allow players to engage early on. 
  - Adjust the game’s design to include random encounters or events that challenge players sufficiently without overwhelming them. 
  - Develop a clearer combat tutorial or introduction that helps players understand enemy behavior and anticipate combat effectively.

**CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 4/10)**
- The player seemed to understand their goal (leveling up the Dodge skill through combat); however, they were systematically unable to achieve it due to a lack of enemy NPCs.
- Feedback from the game (e.g., "You can't go that way") was present but not helpful, as players received little information on viable paths or opportunities for engagement.
- It appears the player was adequately reasoning and attempting to explore using logical actions, suggesting that mechanics around Dodge skill leveling might be clear, but the opportunity to apply them was not.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
  - Provide clear indicators or hints for potential enemy locations on the map to facilitate better navigation towards combat. 
  - Implement a system that gives players contextual feedback on why they can’t move in certain directions or why no enemies appear, which could enhance understanding of the game mechanics.
  - Consider tutorials or guides to reveal hidden aspects of combat mechanics and encouraging exploration more effectively.

**OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 2/10)**
- A real player would likely find this experience tedious and frustrating due to the complete lack of progression and engagement with combat, which is the primary goal.
- Despite some logical reasoning from the player, there was a clear breakdown in the core interaction with the game, leading to a bland experience. Players enjoy progress; not making any left the player unfulfilled.
- The fun factor was negligible, as participation was low, and the goal seemed increasingly unattainable.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**:
  - Reconsider the design of the game world to ensure that it accommodates engagement with enemies effectively. This is critical for maintaining player interest.
  - Increase the frequency of combat opportunities and provide players with multiple avenues for skill leveling to allow for varied gameplay.
  - Explore incorporating side quests or challenges that lead to experience gain while the player seeks combat, which could enrich the overall enjoyment.

In summary, significant design changes are needed to improve the progression system, combat balance, clarity of mechanics, and overall enjoyment of the game. The absence of engaging and rewarding gameplay leads to a hollow experience for players.
