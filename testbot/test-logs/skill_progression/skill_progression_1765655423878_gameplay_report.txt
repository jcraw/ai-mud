            ### PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)
- The player couldn’t make any progress towards leveling the Dodge skill, ending up with a final Dodge level of 0 despite repeated attempts to engage with hostile NPCs. The bottleneck is heavily focused on enemy accessibility.
- The pacing was slow due to the limited exploration options. Players felt trapped in safe zones without any visible enemies to attack, which leads to frustration.
- Progression milestones are nonexistent since the player failed to gain any levels. Reaching Dodge level 1 should have been a manageable goal after a few successful encounters.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Introduce more enemy encounters in the starting zones or provide alternative methods for skill progression in safe areas (e.g., training dummies). Make sure that players have viable options for progression instead of hitting a dead end.

### COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)
- Combat felt overly difficult at the onset, largely due to the lack of available hostile NPCs. While the concept of dodging against enemies is interesting, the player had limited opportunities to actually engage.
- Damage taken was 0, but this is somewhat misleading since the player failed to engage in effective combat. The player’s lack of opportunity led to the eventual death, indicating a misalignment between NPC difficulty and player growth ability.
- Combat mechanics felt unbalanced since the path to interaction with enemies was convoluted and indirect. Players need opportunities to experiment and learn skills like Dodge in combat scenarios.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Ensure that new players face easier enemies that allow immediate combat interactions to learn and level up skills effectively. Consider integrating a tutorial combat scenario where players practice against non-threatening opponents first.

### CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 6/10)
- The game provided indication of what the player needed to do (engage in combat to level Dodge), but the paths available were unclear and limiting. The player was given feedback that many exits led to nowhere, which reduced exploration enthusiasm.
- Feedback was somewhat clear but lacked engaging depth; players may benefit from more guidance or hints when they are stuck. Player reasoning indicates confusion over exit viability.
- Mechanics could be explained better, particularly around how Dodge can be leveled up in tandem with combat engagement. This knowledge could prevent players from feeling lost while trying to progress.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: A clearer map of the playable environments or a mini-tutorial system could provide better guidance on available combat encounters. Include tooltips on skills to educate players on associated actions for progression.

### OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 5/10)
- A real player may find this scenario frustrating rather than enjoyable due to the inability to progress, compounded by actions leading to a dead end. The overall feeling of being lost could deter continuous engagement.
- What worked well: The reasoning process displayed by the player showed they understood their goal of combat and skill leveling. This aspect of problem-solving underlines an engaging potential that can be refined.
- What didn’t work: The lack of enemy interaction severely limited enjoyment; spending time wandering without success reduces the fun factor. Players thrive on combat and growth, so denying these leads to dissatisfaction.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Introduce meaningful encounters that reward exploration and successful combat within the first minutes of gameplay. Balancing frustration with challenge will elevate enjoyment significantly.

---

In summary, review the enemy accessibility within early game zones, revise combat balance with an easier curve at the start, enhance feedback and clarification on mechanics, and ensure player engagement is robust from the get-go. Otherwise, you're setting players on the path to frustration and disengagement.
