            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 5/10)
Progression in this scenario felt somewhat slow. While advancing from Dodge level 4 to 7 is a decent achievement, not reaching the intended goal of level 10 in the allotted time significantly dampens satisfaction. The pacing was on the slower side, with an average of 5 actions per level; this indicates an inefficient progression model. Milestones did not feel impactful—gaining a level incrementally across 3 levels without reaching the goal may lead to frustration in real players.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Introduce more combat opportunities or reduce the XP requirements for higher levels to maintain engagement.
- Consider implementing mini-milestones or rewards for sub-level achievements to create a sense of accomplishment throughout the playthrough.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 6/10)
Combat encounters provided a moderate challenge, but they were slightly skewed toward the easy side as the player took no damage throughout the five combat rounds. The absence of any NPCs resulting in a lethal attack made it feel less engaging and risky, which is usually essential in combat scenarios. While fighting NPCs like the Training Skeleton and Giant Rat had potential, the bot's tendency to avoid damage resulted in a rather uneventful experience.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Adjust the difficulty of the NPCs or introduce a scaling system where enemy difficulty increases as the player's Dodge skill improves.
- Implement mechanics that allow the NPCs to exploit player weaknesses, thus creating more engaging combat scenarios.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 7/10)
The player's goal to level up the Dodge skill was conveyed clearly through their reasoning process and logical decision-making. Feedback from the game was generally clear, particularly during combat and level progression notifications. However, some users might struggle with the understanding of the mechanics for leveling skills, given the implicit nature of needing to be attacked to gain XP in Dodge.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Provide explicit instruction or tutorial sections explaining the nuances of skill leveling. For example, highlight the necessity of being attacked to gain Dodge XP.
- Introduce in-game prompts or tooltips that reinforce learning objectives and strategies during the gameplay to clarify the relationship between actions and skill progression.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 6/10)
While the underlying mechanics and reasoning processes might appeal to dedicated players, the experience itself lacked excitement. The absence of risk (taking damage) during combat and not reaching the goal combined to create an overall feeling of mediocrity. The enjoyment was also hampered by the slow progression and occasionally repetitive actions, which did not contribute positively to player engagement.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Infuse varied and dynamic combat against a diverse array of NPCs to maintain excitement in encounters. 
- Introduce random events or scenarios to break the monotony and keep players on their toes.
- Create a more balanced reward system that recognizes not only level gains but also the decisions made and the risk-taking involved in combat.

In summary, the skill progression experience in this playthrough showed promise but ultimately lacked the depth and engagement to fully capture player interest. Adjusting pacing, improving combat dynamics, and enhancing the clarity of mechanics will significantly improve the overall gameplay experience.
