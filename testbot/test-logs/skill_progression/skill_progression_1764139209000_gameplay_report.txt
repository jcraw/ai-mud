            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)
- **Progress:** The player made no progress in leveling Dodge from 0 to 10. Despite their efforts to seek out combat for skill gain, they ended up with 0 level-ups. The goal was clearly unachievable without a significant change to the encounter dynamics.
- **Pacing:** The pacing felt far too slow given that despite having multiple opportunities for fights, the player couldn’t engage successfully. The lack of NPCs or combat opportunities stunted progression.
- **Milestones:** There were no progression milestones reached. Having a meaningful experience or acknowledgment of effort through incremental feedback is crucial.
- **Suggestions:** Increase the spawn rate of hostile NPCs in the player's vicinity or adjust triggers for enemy engagement. Providing alternative ways to increase Dodge through non-combat scenarios (like evading traps or training sessions) could help as well.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 3/10)
- **Encounters:** The fights were effectively non-existent; the player could not successfully engage with any NPCs. This indicates a critical flaw in either the design of the combat mechanics or the availability of enemies.
- **Damage Balance:** While the player received no damage, this also reflects a lack of engagement rather than balanced challenge. The absence of stakes contributed to a significantly dull experience.
- **Fairness:** Combat did not feel fair at all since there were only unsuccessful attempts to engage; the player faced challenges in a seemingly unbalanced world where combat may require alternative methods to succeed.
- **Suggestions:** Ensure that combat engagement is possible from the get-go. Introduce NPCs that provide varied challenges or levels of engagement to keep the player involved. Adjust the enemy AI to ensure active combat isn't reliant solely on chance.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 4/10)
- **Clarity of Goals:** It was apparent that the goal was to raise Dodge through combat. However, the lack of successful engagement in combat led to confusion if the mechanics for achieving this were clear and effective.
- **Feedback Quality:** The player had adequate reasoning for their actions, showing understanding of mechanics. However, the responses from the AI lacked depth or encouragement, resulting in frustration rather than clarity.
- **Mechanics Explanation:** While it was somewhat clear how to progress, the execution did not align with player intent. Combat mechanics and how the player could successfully engage with NPCs needed clearer articulation.
- **Suggestions:** Provide clearer in-game guidance or tutorial prompts that inform players of potential paths toward engaging in combat. Improve feedback after actions to let players know what they did right or wrong instead of simply "escape" without details.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)
- **Player Experience:** Given the lack of progress and engagement, it is unlikely a player would find enjoyment. The frustration from unresponsive combat and slow progression would diminish overall satisfaction.
- **What Worked Well:** The player showed desires to engage and level up, indicating a good initiation plan. Their reasoning for movement and combat selection was logical and showed they understood the premise.
- **What Didn't Work:** The lack of NPC encounters, combined with the failure to deliver on combat aspirations, created an uninspiring experience and resulted in disengagement.
- **Suggestions:** Introduce initial NPCs that players can interact with right away, serving as both the tutorial and combat engagement all in one. Implement systems where low-level players can practice skills without high stakes to build confidence and interest in the combat system.
