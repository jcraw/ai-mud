            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)

Progressing in the Dodge skill was nearly impossible, as the player ended the session with no increase in their skill level despite 23 combat rounds. The player’s intention to gain experience was clear, yet the mechanics did not support any tangible growth. The issues stemmed from the absence of meaningful feedback or viable actions that would contribute to skill progression. 

The pacing felt off—too slow, given the effort expended with no reward. A pass rate of 30% indicates that even basic actions were not resulting in successful outcomes, which detracted significantly from motivation. Progression milestones were non-existent since the player left with a Dodge level still at zero.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Implement a clearer mechanism that allows players to track their skill progression even from minimal encounters.
- Increase the likelihood of leveling up with minor achievements, particularly at lower levels, such as automatically leveling Dodge after a set number of successful dodges or attacks.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 3/10)

Combat felt imbalanced. The player faced the Training Skeleton multiple times but ended up not dealing fatal blows while simultaneously failing to dodge any attacks. While it is expected for a low-level character to struggle, complete deaths without any opportunity for success can lead to frustration.

Damage balancing was inadequate as the combat seemed to penalize excessively without providing means for counterplay or escape. The absence of balance didn't allow for a fair fight. Even training NPCs shouldn’t result in instant failure; there should be a learning curve that reflects growth over time.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Adjust enemy damage output or player health to avoid instantaneous defeats, allowing room for player mistakes while still giving them a fair chance to learn and evolve.
- Introduce mechanics that allow players to learn from losses (e.g., a minor boost in skill experience from close calls).

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 4/10)

Players should have had a greater understanding of how to engage with the mechanics. The reasoning showcased a commitment to exploring tactics, but the failure to find clear commands led to multiple invalid attempts at prompting the skeleton to attack. The command system significantly hampers clarity when the player repeatedly tries to perform a straightforward action—waiting for an enemy to counterattack. 

Furthermore, the expectations for skill progression did not match the game’s rules. The lack of explicit feedback confused the player about how their actions were supposed to influence skill growth.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Improve command clarity with specific feedback about valid actions. For instance, an explicit message about unavailable commands could simplify user interaction.
- Consider integrating tutorial prompts or hints to clarify how skills like Dodge can be progressed through different actions, potentially within the context of play.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)

Overall enjoyment was likely low for a real player due to a combination of ineffective skill progression, frustration with unclear mechanics, and unbalanced combat. The dedicated reasoning for actions shows commitment; however, the inability to progress would likely diminish player engagement over time. 

What worked was the player’s understanding of the mechanics needed to improve their skill, but that sense of engagement was overshadowed by constant defeats and bureaucratic experience systems that offered zero rewards.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Incorporate a rewarding system that allows players to feel a sense of achievement through small victories, such as completing quests, frequent health boosts, or bonus points for actions taken in combat—even if they don’t lead to an outright win.
- Foster a sense of pacing and gradual improvement: skills can increase not just through direct combat but also through passive experiences served by consistent play, thus avoiding player burnout from simplistic failure. 

By implementing these recommendations, the gameplay experience could be significantly enhanced, enabling players to feel more accomplished and engaged.
