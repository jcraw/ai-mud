            # ANALYSIS OF PLAYTHROUGH

## 1. PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 4/10)

- **Progress Toward Goals**: The player progressed from Dodge level 2 to level 4 over the course of the playthrough but missed the goal of reaching level 10. This suggests a lack of sufficient opportunities for leveling up, especially in relation to the experience required for leveling (40/900 to 700/2500). It's evident that each level requires significantly more experience, which might be discouraging for players.
  
- **Pacing**: The pacing of progression is too slow. With only two level-ups over 13 actions, the experience and level curve can create frustration. The player likely feels the grind without a sense of achievement towards the goal of level 10.

- **Milestones**: Earning just two level-ups in the entire scenario is not very satisfying. Players often seek immediate feedback on their progress, and with a goal of level 10, more consistent milestones could provide that feedback loop.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Increase the experience rewards from combat to allow a smoother progression towards higher levels. Consider implementing more varied sources of experience, such as completing quests, achieving certain combat feats, or introducing loot drops that provide skill XP.

## 2. COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 5/10)

- **Fight Difficulty**: The fights were balanced for the player to survive, but they lacked challenge. With no damage taken and no NPCs defeated, the combats seemed more of an exercise in patience than a test of skill.

- **Damage Balancing**: Damage output seems skewed in favor of the player, with all attacks hitting and no damage received. This may create a false sense of security and reduce tension during encounters. 

- **Engagement**: Combat mechanisms could use more depth. While it is essential to allow players to avoid damage to train Dodge, having them also engage in a way that involves risk could enhance engagement.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Incorporate a damage threshold for NPCs that enables them to deal damage to the player when they miss an attack, allowing for a more balanced and engaging combat experience. Introduce critical hit mechanics or special abilities for NPCs that can occasionally surprise players.

## 3. CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)

- **Goal Clarity**: The player understood the need to engage in combat to gain Dodge XP, but it wasn't clear how much was required for each level and how actions contribute toward the end goal. 

- **Feedback**: Feedback from the system was present but not always clear. The player saw that actions increased XP, but it wasn't intuitively obvious what each action contributed to their overall goal. The UI could do a better job at clearly showing progression metrics.

- **Explanation of Mechanics**: The mechanics could be poorly understood by new players. For someone unfamiliar with MUD dynamics, the need to be attacked to level up Dodge might not be immediately apparent.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Improve the clarity of skill requirements, XP needed per level, and how much experience is earned from specific actions. Consider providing a tutorial or in-game help system that better explains skill mechanics and how they correlate with gameplay.

## 4. OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 6/10)

- **Player Experience**: The experience is moderately enjoyable. Players who enjoy grinding and skill leveling might find this experience rewarding, but it lacks diverse content or challenging mechanics to sustain interest over longer periods.

- **What Worked**: The reasoning behind the player’s actions was logical and showcased strategic thinking. Rooting the gameplay in a familiar combat structure helps lay the groundwork for further development.

- **What Didn't Work**: The repetitive nature of fighting the same NPCs without additional mechanics or narrative motivation can become stale. The high level requirement for progression made the playthrough feel like a tedious grind rather than a fun adventure.

- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Introduce dynamic events, variations in enemy abilities, or environmental challenges to keep the player engaged. Additional narrative elements or quests that tie into skill leveling can create more emotional investment and enjoyment for the players.

--- 

Overall, while the groundwork is solid, significant adjustments are necessary to ensure that players find the progression engaging and rewarding.
