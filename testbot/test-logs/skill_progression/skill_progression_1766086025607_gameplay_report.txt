            # ANALYSIS OF PLAYTHROUGH: SKILL PROGRESSION

## 1. PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 4/10)
- **Progress Toward Goal**: The player struggled significantly to progress their Dodge skill, as they started at level 0 and ended at level 1 after encountering multiple enemies. However, they did not achieve enough combat engagement to gain substantial levels.
- **Pacing**: The pacing was uneven; while the player knew they needed to find combat to progress, it took longer than necessary to locate and engage with hostile NPCs. Spending multiple actions moving between locations without finding enemies is frustrating.
- **Milestones**: The single level-up from Dodge skill 0 to 1 did not offer a satisfying milestone considering the effort taken to get there. The player encountered enemies but could have benefited from a clearer acknowledgment of progress within those interactions.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
  - Streamline the process of locating combat areas or introduce a mechanism that hints at nearby hostiles. 
  - Increase rewards or milestones for small successes (like engaging in a combat round) to create greater satisfaction in progression.

## 2. COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 5/10)
- **Difficulty Level**: Most combat encounters were reasonably balanced against the player's skill level, with enemies able to dodge attacks, promoting engagement. However, the player’s inability to score successful hits until the last encounter created a sense of frustration.
- **Damage Balance**: The player took no damage, suggesting enemies could have been a bit more aggressive to create a more engaging atmosphere. The lack of risk made combat feel less impactful.
- **Fairness and Engagement**: While the mechanics were sound, the repetitive nature of attacking without seeing substantial results led to diminished engagement. Combat could feel stagnant without some variation in the mechanics or outcomes.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
  - Introduce a broader range of enemy behaviors; some could target the player more aggressively, increasing engagement.
  - Allow players to land smaller damage hits to create a more dynamic combat experience while still facing a challenge.

## 3. CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 6/10)
- **Goal Clarity**: The player understood that they needed to engage in combat to level their Dodge skill. However, the lack of clear indicators on when actions would lead to skill advancement left ambiguity regarding their effectiveness.
- **Feedback**: The system provided clear messages about actions and outcomes during combat, but it could benefit from explicit indicators showing the player's current progress towards skill levels and how far they are from the next milestone.
- **Explanation of Mechanics**: The game mechanics were intuitive; however, players without prior experience might find it challenging to know when their Dodging skill is improving.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
  - Provide a visible progress bar for skills that updates after each encounter.
  - Include tooltips or guidance for new players on combat mechanics, particularly how Dodge skill improvement works.

## 4. OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 5/10)
- **Likelihood of Enjoyment**: A real player may find this experience tedious, especially with the slow progression and minimal sense of accomplishment from combat. The lack of challenge (not taking damage) might make the combat feel unengaging.
- **Positive Elements**: The reasoning the player used to make decisions was logical and illustrated a clear understanding of their goals. The game world offered interesting locations to explore.
- **Negative Aspects**: Minimal engagement due to lack of enemy presence in key areas and the frustration stemming from repeated failures to hit enemies lessened overall enjoyment.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: 
  - Introduce a dynamic spawn system for enemies, ensuring players do not have to spend too much time searching and can enjoy combat more consistently.
  - Diversify enemies and combat scenarios to enhance excitement and maintain engagement. 

Overall, while the foundational mechanics of the game and the logic employed by the player was solid, direct interventions in pacing, combat engagement, and skill feedback could positively enhance the gameplay experience.
