            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)
- Making progress toward the goal was difficult. The AI character failed to successfully level up the Dodge skill, having remained at rank 0 throughout the gameplay, which is unacceptable for a skill progression scenario.
- The pacing here is excruciatingly slow; 58 actions without a single level-up indicates a flawed progression system. Players should feel like their efforts yield results at a reasonable rate.
- Progression milestones were almost non-existent, given that no levels were gained. In any skill progression game, hitting milestones—like gaining skill levels—should provide a sense of accomplishment. That's absent here.
- **Suggestion**: Reevaluate the criteria for leveling up skills, such as adjusting how much experience is gained through successful events. Implement smaller milestones to provide players with bite-sized achievements to enhance satisfaction.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 3/10)
- Fights were clearly too difficult. The player character couldn't secure a single victory, leading to a death early on. It indicates that the combat scale may not be appropriately aligned with a character starting at dodge level 0.
- Damage output appears unbalanced as the character suffered no damage but still ended up dying. The mechanics of combat and hitting should be more aligned with the character's skill level.
- Combat did not feel fair or engaging due to an inability to deal damage and an overwhelming advantage for NPCs. Without a chance to level before encountering multiple tough foes, the experience became frustrating rather than fun.
- **Suggestion**: Reduce the difficulty of early encounters for players starting with low skills. Ensure achievement feels possible, and allow for a gradual increase in challenge, not a wall that leads to immediate player demise.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 4/10)
- While the character exhibited a clear understanding of the goal—to engage enemies in combat to improve the Dodge skill—there was a lack of feedback and metrics on progress toward accomplishing this.
- Feedback to the player seemed somewhat opaque. The debug messages present in the playthrough lack context for a player who isn’t familiar with parsing technical information. This can be very discouraging for players trying to track their skill progress.
- Mechanics could definitely be explained better. For instance, players should receive more explicit information on what level of damage they can expect or how much experience they are currently earning per combat encounter.
- **Suggestion**: Enhance in-game tutorials or guides about the mechanics, including clearer explanations of progression systems. Implement clear in-game notifications regarding experience gained during combat.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)
- A real player would likely find this experience tedious and frustrating due to a lack of tangible rewards. Not advancing the Dodge skill after such effort leads to disengagement.
- The repetitive nature of the actions (searching for combat, attacking, fleeing) without ever achieving the goal fails to hold player interest. The strategy expressed through the reasoning is sound, but without corresponding forward motion, it becomes monotonous.
- Fun factor is minimal given the overwhelming challenges and the absence of meaningful milestones or rewards. Engagement does not reach an enjoyable level when the scenario's core mechanics don’t support player progression.
- **Suggestion**: Introduce dynamic feedback loops—like the chance to perform more moves upon successfully dodging or a chance to get minor boosts against weaker foes—to help maintain engagement. Additionally, ensure that the game’s progression mechanics feel rewarding and that players can see and feel their growth in skills consistently.
