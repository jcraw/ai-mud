            **PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)**  
Progressing towards the goal of leveling Dodge was abysmal. The player didn’t level up at all, achieving a total of 0 level-ups after only 6 steps, further emphasizing the lack of significant advancement. The pacing was also terrible; it felt artificially slow as the player was unable to encounter enough enemies to engage with and increase their Dodge skill. The intention behind having a skill progression structure is that upon completing a number of successful actions, the skill should respond accordingly. The mere existence of an opportunity without player advancement leads to frustration.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** Introduce progressively more accessible enemies sooner in the game. Consider implementing a clearer way for the player to find combat opportunities, such as markers or hints indicating low-level enemies nearby as they explore.

**COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 3/10)**  
The combat balance was unfair. Even though two combat encounters occurred, neither resulted in any inflicted damage on the player or combat experience due to the missed attacks. The gameplay felt unengaging as all actions were met with instant failure. With the bot’s attack opportunities yielding no consequences, it negated any chance to learn or adapt, leading to an inevitable death in the second round.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** Adjust enemy difficulty better, ensuring that low-level enemies are winnable for beginners while still providing a learning curve. Incorporate a mechanic where players can guarantee a learning encounter on the first attack of low-difficulty enemies, concurrently increasing the chance to level their skills based on combat participation rather than enemy defeat.

**CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 4/10)**  
The mechanics of progressing through combat are clear in theory but poorly executed in practice. The player understood they needed to engage enemies to level up Dodge; however, they became trapped in a cycle of exploration with no satisfying combat engagement due to unfavorable outcomes. While there was some degree of reasoning exhibited during the playthrough, clarity could be increased by offering more explicit gameplay guidance, like warning the player about the high dodge rate of initial enemies or presenting potential consequences of failing engagements earlier in the exploration.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** Add a tutorial or additional in-game prompts that explain combat mechanics and skill progression. Provide initial lower difficulty enemies to practice on before introducing harder foes to ensure players experience a clear advancement path.

**OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)**  
Real players would likely find this experience very frustrating. The absence of leveling up and the ease with which the player’s defeat occurred detracts from the fun factor. While the desire to engage in combat was clearly present, the lack of results leads to disenchantment. The enjoyment factor was almost non-existent due to endless exploration paired with ineffective combat opportunities, causing the player to feel trapped rather than empowered.  
**Suggestions for Improvement:** Create more engaging and rewarding outcomes from combat, even if unsuccessful, such as learning experience from dodging or close victories against low-tier enemies. Integrating a mechanism that ensures players at least gain skill XP from participation rather than just outcomes could encourage continued gameplay and maintain player engagement.
