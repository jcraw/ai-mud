            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)
The playthrough reflects significant issues with skill progression. The player did not gain any levels in the Dodge skill, despite their clear intent to engage in combat. The fact that they finished with an ending Dodge Level of 0 and zero level-ups indicates that something critical is flawed in the progression mechanics.

**Ease of Progress**: Progress was incredibly difficult. The player was actively searching for combat encounters to be attacked and level up Dodge, only to find encounters consistently yielding no results in terms of skill gain.

**Pacing**: The pacing was unsatisfactory; the player felt compelled to explore multiple directions without any tangible rewards. The repetitive nature of searching for enemies and not finding any resulted in frustration.

**Milestones**: There were no progression milestones achieved. This undermines the sense of accomplishment and purpose inherent in skill building.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Introduce mechanics that reward exploration and combat engagement, possibly through guaranteed experience at lower levels or rate adjustments for Dodge skill gain.
- Ensure there are ample combat opportunities. If players are relying solely on enemy attacks to gain skill, either the enemy spawn rates need to be increased, or alternative methods of gaining Dodge XP should be introduced (e.g., training or dummy targets).
- Implement feedback to clarify what the player might be doing wrong if they aren’t gaining skills, steering them back onto a productive path.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)
The combat mechanics did not seem to provide a relevant challenge, as the player was not actually engaging in successful encounters, leading to no damage taken and no enemies defeated. 

**Difficulty**: Fights were inherently imbalanced; while the player did not acquire damage or kill any NPCs, this reflects more on the engagement mechanics rather than the difficulty of combat. The player failed to engage rather than failing due to difficulty.

**Damage Balance**: It is moot here, as the combat mechanics do not appear to allow for a fair confrontation leading to any damage or experience.

**Fairness and Engagement**: Combat felt entirely unengaging due to the player's inability to succeed in encounters. The lack of challenge was not a product of difficulty but rather of bad engagement.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Increase the variety and frequency of hostile NPCs across the game’s zones to keep combat engaging.
- Implement a system that would allow the player to block or evade attacks that still rewards them with Dodge experience, even if they are defeated.
- Consider adjusting the experience gain mechanism; players could gain Dodge skill experience even by just participating in combat rather than only being hit.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 3/10)
The mechanics behind gaining Dodge skill and the conditions needed to improve it seemed unclear, given that the player was following a sound strategy but achieving no results.

**Goal Clarity**: The player was aware they needed to experience attacks but did not gain any skill points. However, they should have been given clearer guidance on what actions could lead to skill increases.

**Feedback**: While the player had reasoning in their decision-making, the game didn’t adequately express what was needed for skill gain beyond being attacked.

**Mechanics Explanation**: The fundamentals of skill acquisition need to be more transparent. The lack of effective tutorial elements or context leaves players in the dark.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Clearly define how skills improve, possibly through a tutorial or help command that lays out the mechanics and conditions for skill gains.
- Provide feedback within combat to indicate progress or failure towards skill increases. For example, could reveal to the player how close they are to gaining skill as they engage enemies.
- Consider augmenting the UI with notifications that could remind players of their skill goals and how they're progressing.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)
For a real player, the experience would likely yield significant frustration rather than enjoyment due to a lack of meaningful progress and combat engagement.

**Enjoyment Factors**: The player exhibited engagement through their reasoning and decision-making, but this was ultimately overshadowed by a lack of progress.

**What Worked**: The player's methodical approach to find combat and the reasoning they employed shows a level of engagement indicative of strategic thinking. However, the game’s mechanics did not support this positively.

**Fun Factor**: The fun factor is severely diminished due to the repeated failures, lack of skill growth, and ineffective combat encounter availability.

**Suggestions for Improvement**:
- Infuse interesting narrative elements in combat that dynamically reward players aside from skill progression to keep them engaged.
- Implement a reward system that considers exploration and combat engagement to keep players motivated.
- Design more varied encounters that can lead to progressing skills, twists, or side quests that provide context for skill improvement, making the grind more enjoyable.

Overall, the game needs essential improvements in skill progression mechanics, combat engagement, and clearer communication of the game features to enhance the player experience dramatically.
