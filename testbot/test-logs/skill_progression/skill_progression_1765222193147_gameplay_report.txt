            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)
- The player made no progress toward leveling their Dodge skill, as shown by the ending level remaining at 0 and a pass rate of only 57%. The progression was virtually absent because the player couldn't find combat opportunities in critical areas.
- The pacing was severely off; the player spent time exploring but failed to engage in combat due to a lack of available enemies. There needs to be a clearer path to combat encounters from the start.
- Progression milestones were nonexistent in this playthrough. Failing to level up at all is frustrating and discouraging, with no sense of accomplishment achieved.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**:
  - Increase the frequency of combat opportunities in the initial areas to ensure players can make progress faster. Creating a more immediate challenge would lead to satisfying upgrades as players engage with enemies during exploration.
  - Implement an introductory NPC or tutorial mechanism that guides the player toward combat in the early stages. Allow for a learning curve that highlights the pursuits needed to level skills effectively.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 3/10)
- The combat balance was poor. The player’s combat experience culminated in failure, resulting in their death and no meaningful engagement with the Giant Rat Swarm. 
- Damage output and difficulty levels seem unbalanced—the swarm engaging the player without a clear risk of retaliation made the combat experience feel not only punishing but also frustrating.
- The combat did not feel fair; the player was unclear on whether their chances of success were influenced by their skill level or the mechanics of combat itself, leading to an unsatisfying experience.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**:
  - Introduce tutorial monsters or training dummies that allow practice attacks without the risk of dying. This would help players gauge their effectiveness and get comfortable with combat mechanics before facing more potent foes.
  - Consider adding more interactive elements to the combat that showcase skill advantages or introduce alternative strategies that incentivize inciting engagements.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 4/10)
- The player had a reasonable strategy for finding enemies and recognizing the importance of combat for skill leveling. However, the mechanics surrounding skill progression were opaque. The player was often bouncing around with no clear feedback on whether their actions were effective.
- Feedback from the game engine was minimal—though the players' actions were logical, they did not understand the consequences, which led to confusion and wasted actions.
- Mechanics could benefit from improved clarity and additional hints. For instance, the description for the Vault of Beginnings did not convey any potential for combat, leading to inadequate engagement choices.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**:
  - Integrate feedback mechanisms that confirm whether player actions might lead to combat or provide summaries that explain potential dangers in a given location.
  - Enhance descriptions of areas to attract players' attention to hidden dangers nearby or potential enemies, fostering an intuitive understanding of where to find combat opportunities.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)
- It's likely that a real player would find this experience frustrating rather than enjoyable due to the lack of combat opportunities and the failure to progress in skill leveling.
- What worked: The player's reasoning was sound, indicating that they understood the goal of leveling the Dodge skill through combat. 
- What didn’t work: The overall lack of combat encounters made the entire playthrough dull, and encountering a dead-end repeatedly can sap motivation. Even after attacking, facing frustration without success can detract from the experience significantly.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**:
  - To increase enjoyment levels, consider implementing more frequent, engaging questlines or missions that prompt combat encounters. These could offer temporary buffs or rewards that encourage players to engage.
  - Create a more dynamic environment where players can see potential enemies or opportunities actively, making the world feel richer and enhancing the excitement for challenges.

Overall, the playthrough lacks sufficient engagement and clarity, leading to frustration instead of fulfillment. Revising combat balance and mechanics to offer satisfactory player feedback will enhance skill progression and combat depth.
