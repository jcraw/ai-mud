            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)
The player aimed to increase their Dodge skill from level 0 to 10 through active combat. However, they made no progress, ending at the same skill level. This indicates a significant issue in the progression mechanics, where either opportunities for leveling up were insufficient or unclear. 

The pacing was poor, as the player engaged in numerous combat attempts without any indication of progress towards their goal. The lack of level-ups leads to frustration and disconnection from player motivation. Progress milestones were completely absent, creating a feeling of stasis.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Implement clearer milestones for skill advancements, even if small increments are involved, such as a notification or a more visible XP tracking system.
- Adjust the XP gain mechanics to reward any engagement, even partial, within combat dynamics to encourage a sense of achievement.
- Ensure that combat triggers XP gain appropriately; if a player is successfully dodged against an opponent, they should receive at least nominal XP to signify progress.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)
Throughout the combat experience, the player engaged multiple enemies but did not receive substantial threats from them. While the enemies spawned (Giant Rats and Training Skeletons) seem valid, they did not pose a real challenge or offer variability in combat mechanics. 

Damage taken was consistently zero, suggesting the player's strategy to absorb damage was too effective, voiding the purpose fueling their skill development. This imbalance made combat less engaging.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Review enemy AI to ensure they pose an adequate threat to players, allowing for a more balanced exchange of attacks.
- Introduce varied NPCs with different attack patterns that target the Dodge skill more effectively, making the encounters dynamic.
- Create environments where players can force enemies to engage actively, such as traps or mechanics that increase their likelihood of being attacked.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)
The player's understanding of the need to engage enemies for Dodge skill points was clear; however, after numerous attempts with no reward, clarity on achieving the goal faltered. The player repeatedly sought combat and identified potential enemies, illustrating their understanding, but the mechanics lacked transparency regarding how XP was awarded.

There was no constructive feedback from the system on leveled-up status, making it hard for players to gauge if they were genuinely progressing towards skill advancement.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Implement a more comprehensive feedback system post-combat indicating how much XP was gained or lost based on combat performance.
- Introduce clearer in-game documentation or tutorials that detail how skill gain mechanics function, especially for new players.
- Provide visual or textual indicators when an opportunity to gain Dodge XP is presented, helping players understand possible outcomes from engagements.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 4/10)
A real player would likely find this experience tedious and frustrating. Engagement in combat without achieving tangible results reduces the fun factor and may lead to disengagement. The repetitive nature of combat without progress can dishearten players, especially with a failed attempt at leveling the skill.

Parts that worked included the thematic descriptions of the environments and the ongoing player reasoning when preparing for engagements. However, the focus on successfully growing a skill fell flat.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Create exciting moments, like boss encounters or unexpected enemy spawns, to elevate engagement rather than a focus on consistent foe combat.
- Offer alternative methods for leveling skills that don’t solely rely on combat, such as completing quests or challenges relevant to avoiding attacks.
- Increase player interaction with the world, making combat encounters feel less repetitive through evolving enemy spawn scenarios or skill-affecting events. 

In conclusion, the AI MUD game needs a significant overhaul in progression mechanics, combat balance, clarity of game mechanics, and thematic enjoyment to foster a rewarding player experience.
