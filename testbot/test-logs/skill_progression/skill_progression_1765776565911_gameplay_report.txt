            # PLAYTHROUGH ANALYSIS

## PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)

- **Progress Towards Goal**: Progressing the Dodge skill was ineffective. The player started at level 0 and ended at level 0 after eight actions, showing a disconnect between intended gameplay and outcomes.
- **Pacing**: The pacing felt off; the player could explore but was unable to engage in meaningful combat early on, halting progress. There should be more accessible pathways or quests that allow players to engage quickly.
- **Progression Milestones**: There were no milestones achieved during the playthrough, and a lack of tangible rewards for actions led to feelings of stagnation and frustration.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Implement clearer pathways to enemies or introduce low-level challenges that push the player to engage early. Consider integrating quicker reward mechanics where gaining experience can occur from exploratory actions or engaging with the environment.

## COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 5/10)

- **Combat Difficulty**: The combat encounters available to the player felt uninspiring; none occurred until the very end, which detracted from learning the Dodge skill effectively. The presence of only 2 NPCs (Giant Rat and Training Skeleton) may have contributed to the feeling that the player was initially untapped for growth.
- **Damage Management**: The player did not take damage during the playthrough and did not kill any NPCs, which indicated a lack of real combat engagement, hence balance seems irrelevant.
- **Engagement Level**: The combat system has the potential for engagement but was underutilized due to the environment design, which created a safe zone that delayed encounters.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Increase NPC availability and perhaps vary their strength to make initial encounters less punishing but still meaningful. Introduce combat mechanics where a few dodged attacks provide experience even if the player doesn't completely defeat an enemy.

## CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)

- **Goal Clarity**: While the player understood that they were to engage enemies to level the Dodge skill, the mechanics for achieving this goal were somewhat obscured by safe zones and unclear directions.
- **Feedback to Player**: Though the reasoning was clear from the player’s thoughts, there were instances where the I'm faced with multiple prompts that were repetitive or uninformative, particularly around why they could or could not go certain directions.
- **Explanations**: The mechanics could be described better—especially around engaging NPCs and what conditions trigger combat opportunities.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Offer more explicit instructions or hints through the narrative or NPCs in the safe zones that guide players towards meaningful combat engagements. Modify regions where players can receive more comprehensive feedback about environmental interactions.

## OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 4/10)

- **Player Enjoyment**: Given the playthrough, a real player would likely find this experience lackluster due to the inability to engage with combat meaningfully or advance in skill level, resulting in diminished excitement and a sense of achievement.
- **What Worked and What Didn’t**: The conceptualization of a skill progression system using combat is solid; however, the execution faltered on multiple fronts—pacing, accessibility to enemies, and meaningful player feedback. A lack of combat engagement overshadowed the mechanics.
- **Fun Factor**: There was potential for fun, particularly in combat dynamics, but it was unfulfilled due to too much setup without without payoff. 
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Increase player engagement by shortening the path to combat encounters or offering incentives that reward exploration outside of combat. Consider restructuring combat environments to ensure at least minimal engagement occurs within the first few turns.

In summary, while the intention of the skill progression system through combat holds promise, the execution needs significant refinement to create a more rewarding and engaging gameplay experience. Focus on improving combat accessibility and skill progression pacing for a better overall player journey.
