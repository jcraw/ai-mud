            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)
The player attempted to level their Dodge skill from 0 to 10 but ended with a Dodge level of 0 and a total of 0 level-ups. This indicates a major issue with the skill progression system. The player faced a severe obstacle as they were unable to effectively accrue experience points for the skill based on their actions.

- **Ease of Progress**: It was nearly impossible to make any progress since they ended at the same level. The strategy of needing to be attacked to gain Dodge XP is understandable, but there wasn't a clear mechanism for the player to achieve their goal, especially given their low attacking capabilities.
- **Pacing**: Progress felt overwhelmingly slow, almost nonexistent. There were no tangible milestones in skill advancement despite repeated attempts to gain experience.
- **Satisfaction of Milestones**: Given that the player didn’t reach any milestone, a sense of achievement was entirely absent.
- **Suggestions**: Implement a system where players can consistently see a minimum level of XP accrual for being attacked in combat. Ensure players can target weaker opponents or have encounters balanced appropriately for skill leveling.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)
Although the combat had potential, it ultimately resulted in frustration without a clear balance.

- **Difficulty of Fights**: The fights seem too challenging for a player starting with low Dodge skills. The player deployed a repetitive strategy of provoking NPC attacks to improve survival, but encountered continuous failures despite their efforts to engage appropriately.
- **Damage Balance**: The engagement mechanics suggest an issue with the NPCs’ ability to dodge the player’s attacks, which adds to the imbalance and renders the combat unpredictable.
- **Engagement Feel**: The process of needing attacks to level a defense skill is intriguing but ended up feeling tedious and unrewarding in terms of combat fairness.
- **Suggestions**: Revise NPC attack rates to allow for more predictable interactions. Introduce varying enemy difficulty levels based on the player's skill levels, and include meaningful consequences or rewards for defeating weaker NPCs.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)
While players had a decent grasp of what they needed to do to level their Dodge skill, the mechanics were convoluted and poorly explained.

- **Goal Clarity**: The player understood they needed to be attacked to level Dodge, but had limited means of understanding effective combat strategies, especially within the confines of the current commands.
- **Feedback Clarity**: There was a lack of effective feedback, especially in combat results. Players encountered many unknown commands that detracted from their ability to engage and strategize effectively.
- **Mechanics Explanation**: "Defend" being an unknown command is baffling in a combat-driven environment where dodging (a form of defense) is critical to growth. Clear guidance on available actions would greatly enhance the experience.
- **Suggestions**: Provide a tutorial or a clearer command guide that explicates how to use defensive maneuvers. Better verbal or textual feedback regarding what skills or strategies lead to success in Dodge skill leveling should be available.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)
Overall, the playthrough lacked the engagement and fun that players would expect from a skill progression game.

- **Player Enjoyment**: The real player in this scenario would likely feel frustration due to the lack of available options, clarity in mechanics, and absence of skill progression despite dedicated effort.
- **What Worked**: The basic premise of leveling up through combat and dodge mechanics is a great hook.
- **What Didn’t Work**: The complete lack of progress and the unclear commands severely hindered enjoyment. Trying the same strategies and yielding the same unsatisfactory results created a repetitive and unengaging experience.
- **Suggestions**: Implement systems to ensure that players can feel meaningful progression, including the introduction of tiered enemies with scalable difficulty. Incorporate regular feedback updates that highlight player skill improvements even if they are minor, to encourage further engagement.
