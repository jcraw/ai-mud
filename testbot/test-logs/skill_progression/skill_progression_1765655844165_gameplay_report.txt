            # FEEDBACK ON PLAYTHROUGH OF skill_progression

## 1. PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)
- **Ease of Progress:** Progress was nearly non-existent, indicated by the starting and ending Dodge levels both being 0. The player did not level up at all (0 level-ups), suggesting that the tasks at hand did not yield any meaningful advancement.
- **Pacing:** The pacing was too slow; within a short playtime of approximately 45 seconds, the player achieved zero progress toward their goal of leveling the Dodge skill. 
- **Milestones:** There were no satisfying progression milestones because there was no growth or achievements reached during the playthrough.
- **Suggestions for Improvement:** 
   - Introduce low-risk, high-reward combat scenarios that allow players to accumulate some experience points even in safe zones.
   - Consider adding tutorial elements or small-scale encounters that grant minor boosts to skills, fostering a sense of immediate progression.

## 2. COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)
- **Fight Difficulty:** The combat was essentially non-existent; the player never engaged an enemy successfully due to being in a safe zone or failing to land attacks on the Giant Rat.
- **Damage Balance:** No damage taken means there was no opportunity to gauge balance. Combat felt disengaged and lacked the potential stakes that would make players think strategically about Dodge skill use.
- **Fairness of Combat:** Combat was not engaging or fair due to insufficient encounters. The mechanics surrounding the combat were not put to the test.
- **Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - Make sure players can encounter low-level enemies in the initial zones to ensure that combat is readily available.
   - Implement a system where success in combat isn’t solely based on attack rolls but also on opportunity actions (evading, mitigating damage, etc., to promote skill growth).

## 3. CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)
- **Clarity of Goals:** The goal was clear—level the Dodge skill through combat. However, players were limited by exploration mechanics and safe zones initially leading to no combat.
- **Feedback Mechanism:** There was little feedback due to not engaging meaningfully with the NPCs or combat mechanics.
- **Need for Explanation:** The reasoning process was present although rudimentary. More descriptive guidance or tool-tips would enhance clarity around combat mechanics and how to effectively progress in the game.
- **Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - Provide clearer information about which locations contain enemies and compensatory mechanics to help players navigate to them.
   - Implement tutorial prompts that explain how Dodge skill can be leveled and the mechanics behind combat engagement.

## 4. OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 4/10)
- **Player Enjoyment:** A real player may find this experience frustrating rather than enjoyable, due to the lack of progress and meaningful engagement.
- **What Worked:** The reasoning and attempt to strategize for combat engagement showed potential. The world-building hints indicated a more expansive universe, but it remained untapped during the session.
- **What Didn't Work:** The inability to engage in combat or level the Dodge skill led to an empty experience, lacking excitement or fulfillment.
- **Suggestions for Improvement:**
   - Create a more dynamic starting area where new players can immediately engage in combat that influences skill progression, even if in minimal ways.
   - Increase engagement by giving players tools and choices that allow them to take more control of their combat experience, fostering a sense of autonomy within the gameplay flow.

In conclusion, the core mechanics seem promising but require significant tuning to enhance player experience, particularly around combat engagement and skill progression. Revamping the starting areas and increasing opportunities for combat would greatly improve overall satisfaction.
