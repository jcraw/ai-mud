            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)
The progress towards leveling the Dodge skill was severely hindered. The player ended at Dodge level 0 despite multiple combat attempts. The pacing felt unintentionally slow as the player faced numerous enemies without gaining the anticipated skill progress. While the logical reasoning from the player indicated awareness of the mechanics, the lack of any level-ups indicates a failure in the system to reward the players' actions adequately. The absence of clear milestones adds to the frustration, as players generally expect a sense of achievement after such engagements. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Implement clearer requirements for leveling up a skill. Introduce thresholds for Dodge XP that inform players how their actions contribute towards leveling.
- Increase the rate at which Dodge skill can be gained through successful defenses, or introduce a low-level training mechanism that ensures players can make progress in skill even from defensive maneuvers.
- Design a checklist or notification system that shows how close players are to leveling up their skills to help maintain motivation.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)
Combat outcomes do not reflect the expected balance for engaging low-level NPCs. The player faced multiple enemies, yet managed minimal success in dodging or causing damage, resulting in their eventual defeat after several turns. With the participatory nature of the combat mechanics, the player was able to attack, but there seemed to be an overwhelming number of miss outcomes that left the engagement feeling futile. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Reassess the damage output of higher-level enemies in relation to a player with a base Dodge skill. The accruing experience should be a factor of consistent engagement without immediate overwhelming threats.
- Consider adding mechanics where lower-level characters can receive a minor bonus against NPCs of their level, such as guaranteed damage or serendipitous successful dodges to create a fairer combat environment.
- Introduce a distinct probability of miss/hit that can be more forgiving, especially considering the earlier stage of skill progression for the player.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)
Mechanics for leveling up Dodge and the requirements for engaging combat were understood by the player, but the interface did not offer sufficient feedback. Although the player understood that engaging in combat with enemies would help, the absence of detailed guidance regarding the skill progression and combat expectations led to confusion. The lack of visual or auditory cues when a skill level increases or improves made the experience less engaging.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Provide tooltips or a dedicated help section that outlines how skills are gained and any benefits associated with leveling them up.
- Implement in-game notifications or a combat log that will highlight successful skill improvements, even if small, to help players recognize their contributions.
- Include descriptions of the enemies that clarify their difficulty and associated threats, which would help players better strategize their combat engagements.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)
The overall enjoyment of the gameplay fell short largely due to frustration stemming from the inability to see progress. Engaging combat with various enemies felt repetitive, and the lack of tangible rewards made the experience feel tedious. The player was engaged in their reasoning but may have easily lost interest without visible accomplishments. 

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Increase rewarding experiences within combat, such as experience points, items, or even monetary rewards to enhance motivation and enjoyment.
- Consider adding dynamic elements to combat, such as combo abilities or environmental factors that can aid in training skills and provide the player with methods to strategize beyond mere attacks.
- Introduce regular narrative or world-building updates that enhance engagement and provide players with a sense of purpose, breaking up the monotony of combat scenarios.

By addressing these key issues, future playthroughs could provide more satisfying and rewarding experiences, ultimately increasing player retention and enjoyment.
