            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)
The progress toward leveling the Dodge skill from 0 to 10 was hindered significantly, as there were no actual level-ups during the playthrough. The player's strategy of letting enemies attack seemed sound in theory but executed poorly in practice. Progression was painfully slow, leaving the player stuck at Dodge level 0 throughout.

Pacing was lethargic; the expectation to reach a higher level within 348 seconds (almost 6 minutes) with no tangible reward or milestones is frustrating. Given that there were no level-ups or clear metrics to indicate progress despite engaging in combat, players would likely feel demotivated.

Milestones were absent. No improvements or increments in skill levels were recorded, which is disheartening in any RPG scenario. The satisfaction expected from seeing progression—however minimal—was clearly missing.

**Recommendations:**
- Introduce smaller, more frequent skill progression milestones. For instance, even a small incremental reward for each successful dodge could keep players engaged.
- Provide feedback on experience gained after each encounter or clear indicators of the player's progression toward a level-up to create a sense of advancement.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)
Combat was fundamentally flawed. The player engaged in fights but ultimately relied too much on the enemies to help level up their Dodge skill without any offensive strategy. The idea of allowing NPCs to attack without any repercussions only worked against the player’s advancement, leading to an unsustainable combat approach.

Fights against the Giant Rat and Weak Goblin felt unbalanced. They were supposed to be manageable opponents, yet the player ended up not taking any damage, which negates the learning experience that comes from combat. The absence of damage in a scenario designed for skill leveling prevented a proper risk-reward ratio for engaging combat.

Combat fairness was notably lacking; it felt more like a chore than an engaging challenge. Dodging without actively interacting added an undesirable layer of passiveness.

**Recommendations:**
- Adjust combat mechanics to ensure that some damage is taken, or at least offer a penalty for passive dodging to foster a more balanced and engaging combat experience.
- Introduce active HP loss to create urgency, promoting more dynamic combat that encourages both offense and defense. Consider implementing a “training” mechanic where consistent dodging leads to incremental gains.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)
There was a basic understanding of the goal (to level up Dodge), but how to attain that goal wasn’t communicated effectively. The player’s approach—simply allowing enemies to attack—was established, but there were no clear indications of why this was the only valid strategy. The feedback received was passive and repetitive, leading to confusion about how skill progression genuinely works.

Feedback from the system lacked depth. Although combat logs were clear about what occurred during fights, there was minimal contextual help or instructions guiding the player on what constitutes a meaningful action outside of "letting enemies attack." 

**Recommendations:**
- Offer clearer tutorials or hints during the early combats to outline how Dodge skill leveling works, emphasizing active participation in combat.
- Implement an indicator of experience gained per successful dodge or failed attack to lend clarity to the player's actions. 

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 2/10)
Considering a real player's experience, enjoyment would be dramatically low. The monotony of simply letting NPCs attack the player without any risk or reward wouldn’t captivate or engage most players. The repetitive nature of the playthrough would likely lead to frustration rather than fun, undermining the essence of action in an RPG setting.

In this scenario, very little worked well. Players aren’t likely to enjoy a gameplay experience that offers no visible progression, fails to engage them in combat, and lacks satisfying mechanics. The "fun factor" practically evaporated in the absence of active involvement in combat.

**Recommendations:**
- Inject excitement into the combat mechanics with dynamic interactions and consequences for skills used, making battles a blend of strategy and reflex.
- Ensure that there's a balance of risk and reward. For instance, allowing players to attack or defend should both impact their progress in meaningful ways, breaking the monotony of just waiting for hits. 

Overall, this design requires considerable revision to ensure that both the progression experience and combat phases are engaging, dynamic, and rewarding.
