            ## PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)

The progression in this scenario was dismal. The player started at level 7 for the Dodge skill but ultimately remained at the same level after four combat rounds. This indicates a significant lack of opportunities for skill development. The average actions per level was disappointingly low, suggesting that the mechanics were not set up effectively to incentivize skill growth through combat engagement.

Pacing was also an issue; the player quickly realized they could not progress without finding hostile NPCs but spent the majority of their time navigating rather than engaging in combat. The goal of reaching level 10 was not met, and not achieving milestones can lead to frustration rather than satisfaction.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Increase the frequency of encounters with hostile NPCs, particularly in areas the player can access.
- Consider implementing a system that rewards participation in combat, even if it doesn’t lead to a level with incremental experience points for each dodge or combat engagement.
- Provide clearer milestones or checkpoints in skill progression to keep player morale high.

## COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)

Combat balance was not well executed in this gameplay session. While the encounters were set up to allow for engagement, the player faced a series of problems: notably they attacked NPCs but did not receive any real risk due to no incoming damage. The player was unable to die or experience any consequences, which diminished the overall tension and excitement of combat.

Additionally, since the player’s actions culminated in a lack of progress due to minimal enemy engagements, it felt tedious rather than rewarding. Although damage values were not explicitly listed, the lack of successful hits and progress suggests an imbalance where combat lacked difficulty necessary for growth.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Adjust the mechanics so players take some damage or penalties for not dodging, providing tangible experiences from combat.
- Introduce a wider variety of NPCs with differences in strength and abilities to create more engaging combat without overwhelming lower-level players.
- Rework the combat mechanics for better interaction, possibly incorporating elements like critical hits or dodging rewards.

## CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)

The mechanics were somewhat clear, but not effectively communicated to support player understanding. The focus on engaging enemies for leveling up Dodge skill was clear, yet the way to find charging NPCs wasn’t as straightforward as it could have been. The player spent excessive time exploring without success, leading to a time-wasting cycle that wasn’t engaging.

Feedback from the game after each combat round was present but lacked clarity in terms of what the player needed to do to make efficient progress. The objective to level up Dodge was clear, but a more robust guide on finding and engaging enemies effectively could enhance user experience.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Incorporate clearer indications when players are in an area with potential enemy spawning.
- Provide tutorial content or tips on the consequence of combat choices in real-time, especially if an encounter appears non-threating.
- Include clearer statistics around Dodge skill progression post-combat to align player actions with their goals.

## OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 4/10)

Overall, player enjoyment in this scenario would likely be rated unfavorably. The primary goal was to level up the Dodge skill through combat, but the frustrations stemming from exploration without engagement and lack of measurable progress dampened the experience. The player likely faced boredom rather than enjoyment as their knowledge of what needed to be done was overshadowed by their inability to execute effectively.

While some aspects, such as the reasoning behind actions, were well-presented, the game ultimately felt unfulfilling due to incomplete progression. Combat mechanisms that promote decision-making would likely enhance enjoyment.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Improve NPC spatial distribution and respawn rates to provide more proactive combat opportunities.
- Add a reward system for minor achievements even if players do not meet their final goals to bolster engagement.
- Conduct playtesting focusing on user experience to ensure the mechanics align with enjoyment and engagement levels.
