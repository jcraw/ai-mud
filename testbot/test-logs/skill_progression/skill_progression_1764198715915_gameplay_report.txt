            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 4/10)
The player struggled significantly to make progress towards leveling the Dodge skill, ending up at Level 0 after several encounters. Achieving a level of 10 seemed impossible under the current experience system, with no levels gained, which is frustrating. The pacing felt off; the gradual increase in XP is not working when the player has to attack or dodge multiple times but isn’t rewarded sufficiently. Progression milestones are virtually non-existent, and the entire experience feels tedious rather than satisfying. 

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Implement a more forgiving XP system that rewards the player for attempts, even if they fail to land attacks. Consider a system that gives XP for simply participating in combat actions, even if dodging fails.
- Introduce a minimum XP gain per combat round to provide a sense of accomplishment.
- Rethink the levels, perhaps introducing incremental rewards for reaching thresholds of XP that lead to quicker leveling. 

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 5/10)
Combat balance was largely skewed in favor of the NPCs, especially with players facing weak enemies like weak goblins and getting stuck in an unproductive combat loop. The player engaged multiple times with the same enemy, leading to no real progress or danger but few rewarding actions, which made the experience feel stale. Damage output wasn’t a primary concern because the player primarily dodged without prior damage taken; however, the combat felt unfair as it led to player death without any real chance of retaliating effectively.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Rethink the enemy AI behavior—balance the attack patterns so that even weak NPCs don’t become stale due to repetitive failures and misses.
- Introduce a “back-off” mechanic, allowing players to disengage from a combat situation and prevent getting stuck fighting a single enemy.
- Balance enemy damage to make it a more dynamic experience where both player and NPC can influence the fight’s outcome positively. 

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 6/10)
While it was relatively clear that the goal was to level the Dodge skill through combat, there was insufficient feedback regarding how XP was achieved. The indications of combat success or failure were minimal, leaving players uncertain about whether their strategies were sound. The commands available to engage in actions could be more intuitive or better communicated—players struggled with commands like “wait,” which were unrecognized.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Enhance the feedback system when players take actions. Clear notifications of what actions contribute towards XP would help retain player focus.
- Provide clearer instructions or a beginner’s guide that elaborates on combat strategies and mechanics before engaging in battles.
- Include more responsive commands or synonyms, so they don’t receive negative feedback on valid attempts.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 5/10)
A real player might find parts of this experience engaging—combat mechanics provide excitement; however, the overall degradation of meaningful advancement can lead to frustration. There were moments of tactical reasoning, particularly when the player strategized around their engagements, but repeated cycles of combat without results can sap enjoyment. The lack of satisfying progression milestones hampers engagement levels.

**Suggestions for improvement:**
- Integrate more storytelling elements or rewards for achievements to inspire more engagement outside of skill leveling—characters, lore, and interactive world-building will retain player interest.
- Offer incentives for diverse strategies—encourage finding unique enemy types or combinations to earn bonus XP.
- Revise the engagement cycle to promote satisfaction in combat outcomes. More randomness or surprises in the gameplay could bolster excitement levels.

In conclusion, while there are notable benefits from strategic evaluations and NPC interactions, the implementation of leveling, combat balance, feedback mechanisms, and overall enjoyment measurements requires significant improvements to make the experience worthwhile and satisfying for the player.
