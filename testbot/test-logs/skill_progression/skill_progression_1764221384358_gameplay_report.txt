            **PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)**  
The player's progression towards the Dodge skill is essentially nonexistent, as they ended at Level 0. This indicates significant issues with the mechanics of skill progression. The rate at which the player could acquire skill experience was frustratingly low, mainly due to their failure to engage in sufficient combat. The lack of level-ups and overall skill progression suggests that the mechanics might not incentivize or guide players effectively towards their goal.  
**Suggestions for improvement:**  
- Introduce a more straightforward method for players to gain experience quickly at lower levels, such as easier combat encounters or rewards for engaging in certain activities.
- Create clear progression milestones that offer tangible rewards or abilities at various skill levels to motivate players to continue training.

**COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)**  
The combat system lacks balance, primarily because the player died without achieving any meaningful engagement. While it may have been intended as a challenging experience, the player was given no real opportunity to learn or experiment with dodge mechanics through combat engagement with enemies. Given that the player initially faced the Giant Rat King—arguably a simple NPC—dying does not lend itself to a balanced experience.  
**Suggestions for improvement:**  
- Decrease damage output or increase defensive capabilities for initial encounters to ensure that players can test skills without facing immediate death.
- Ensure there are clearer indicators of enemy strength and player preparedness, allowing players to strategize better before engaging in combat.

**CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)**  
While some mechanics were somewhat clear, such as needing to engage in combat to level up skills, the overall clarity was undermined by the vague nature of feedback received. For instance, the player struggled to find enemies and faced a die-one-led progression—a factor that can make mechanics appear unnecessarily convoluted. Additionally, the description of the surroundings and available actions could be more explicit, giving players a clearer path toward conflict and learning.  
**Suggestions for improvement:**  
- Enhance descriptions of areas to include hints or indications of where enemies might be found.
- Provide clearer guidance on how combat interactions specifically contribute to skill leveling; this could be in the form of tutorials or response prompts suggesting what actions players could take.

**OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 4/10)**  
Based on the playthrough, a real player would likely find this experience frustrating rather than enjoyable. The lack of meaningful progression, combined with the unclear mechanics and unbalanced combat, contributes to a dull experience. While the environment offers potential for exploration and combat, the execution falls short of providing fun or engaging gameplay.  
**Suggestions for improvement:**  
- Focus on bolstering the early gameplay experience, ensuring players can see and feel their growth through combat and exploration; allowing for easy wins will keep them engaged.
- Foster an environment where player actions lead to immediate, enjoyable consequences, turning fraught encounters into opportunities for learning and improvement.

In summary, there are significant areas for improvement in skill progression, combat balance, mechanics clarity, and overall player enjoyment. Prioritize addressing the issues related to early game frustration and engagement to enhance the overall experience.
