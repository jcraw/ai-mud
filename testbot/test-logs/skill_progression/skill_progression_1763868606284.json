You escape to safety.\nYou move south.\n\nUnknown Location\n----------------\nYou find yourself enveloped in the suffocating embrace of the Veil of Desolation, where the air is thick and stifling, as if the very atmosphere conspires to hold you in place. The stone walls, rough and uneven, seem to absorb the flickers of light that barely penetrate the oppressive gloom, creating an unsettling harmony of shadow and silence. A faint, uneasy hum reverberates through the space, echoing the weight of countless untold stories, while an unseen force urges you forward, weaving a tapestry of dread and anticipation that lingers in the depths of your mind.\n\nExits: north (Unknown Location), northeast (Unknown Location), southwest (Unknown Location)\n\nYou see:\n  - Training Skeleton #1 (neutral)\n  - Weak Goblin #1 (neutral)\n  - Giant Rat #1 ⚔️  (hostile - glares at you!)\n[PROCESS NPC DEBUG] Called processNPCTurns(), turnQueue=true, monsterAIHandler=true\n[PROCESS NPC DEBUG] currentTime=804, queueSize=7, nextEntry=(npc_2417768d-f9a2-4cb5-9f5d-44f89b1a1edc, 800)\n[PROCESS NPC DEBUG] currentTime=804, queueSize=7, nextEntry=(npc_c8ec6d64-9f8d-4b93-bcd9-9e1b7ba9596a, 800)\n\nGiant Rat #1 attacks you!\n[COMBAT DEBUG] Attacker: Giant Rat #1 (NPC)\n[COMBAT DEBUG]   - SkillComponent: FOUND\n[COMBAT DEBUG]   - NPC components: [COMBAT, SKILL, SOCIAL]\n[COMBAT DEBUG] Defender: Test Adventurer (Player)\n[COMBAT DEBUG]   - CombatComponent: FOUND\n[COMBAT DEBUG]   - SkillComponent: FOUND\n[SKILL CLASSIFIER DEBUG] Action: Giant Rat #1 attacks\n[SKILL CLASSIFIER DEBUG] Entity has skills: [Melee Combat, Dodge, Parry]\n[SKILL CLASSIFIER DEBUG] Unlocked skills: [Melee Combat, Dodge, Parry]\n[SKILL CLASSIFIER DEBUG] Trying LLM classification\n[SKILL CLASSIFIER DEBUG] LLM result: [SkillWeight(skill=Strength, weight=0.5), SkillWeight(skill=Agility, weight=0.3), SkillWeight(skill=Unarmed Combat, weight=0.2)]\n[COMBAT DEBUG]   - Using skill Strength: level=0 (weight=0.5)\n[COMBAT DEBUG]   - Using skill Agility: level=0 (weight=0.3)\n[COMBAT DEBUG]   - Using skill Unarmed Combat: level=0 (weight=0.2)\n[COMBAT DEBUG] Total attack modifier: 0\nWith a vicious snarl, the Giant Rat lunges, sinking its jagged teeth deep into the player's throat\nGiant Rat #1 hits you for 9 damage!
