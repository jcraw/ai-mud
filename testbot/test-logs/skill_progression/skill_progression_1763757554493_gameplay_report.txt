            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)
Making progress toward the goal of leveling the Dodge skill was virtually non-existent during this playthrough. With a starting level of 0 and an ending level of 0, the mechanics governing progression were either not functioning or excessively restrictive. The absence of percentage progression or a minimal leveling opportunity made the gameplay extremely frustrating.

- **Pacing**: Progression felt entirely stagnant. In a game structured around skill leveling, the inability to experience even a single level-up in 448 seconds is unacceptable.
- **Milestones**: No milestones were achieved, which can lead to disengagement and frustration. Players require tangible achievements to maintain motivation. 
- **Suggestions**: Introduce more opportunities for combat in the early game. Ensure that players can engage with enemies promptly to facilitate skill leveling. Redesign the environment to provide clearer pathways for exploration and a better chance to encounter hostile NPCs.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 3/10)
Combat was not present in a meaningful way, as evidenced by only one combat round and zero NPCs killed.

- **Difficulty Level**: While it might indicate a well-balanced difficulty if players were engaging, the significant lack of combat rendered this irrelevant. 
- **Damage & Fairness**: No player damage or interaction with enemies occurred, leading to a blank slate for evaluating damage balance and combat engagement. 
- **Suggestions**: Implement a system where combat encounters are more frequent, especially in the opening areas. Include weaker NPCs or prevent walls from blocking movement entirely to allow players to interact continuously within the ecosystem.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)
There were clear indicators pointing to the player's understanding of their goal to level up Dodge, but the paths to achieve this were poorly laid out.

- **Visibility of Goals**: The player understood that they needed to engage in combat to raise their Dodge skill, but they were perpetually thwarted in their attempts to find enemies.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Feedback from the game regarding movement was consistently “You can't go that way,” which detracted from the fluid gameplay experience. 
- **Suggestions**: Improve geographic layout or remove walls that prevent movements that could lead to enemies. It might also help to provide hints or guidance in the environment or NPC presence that goad players to combat situations where they can grow their skills.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 2/10)
The gameplay experience would be highly unsatisfying for real players, primarily due to the lack of meaningful engagement.

- **What Worked**: The reasoning process showcased by the AI demonstrated strategic thinking, aiming to find opponents to engage with.
- **What Didn’t**: However, the overwhelming inability to make progress would frustrate players, earning a feeling of futility from repetitive commands with no results.
- **Fun Factor**: Engagement was at an all-time low. Players enjoy exploration and skill growth, both of which were stifled here.
- **Suggestions**: Create a more dynamic exploration and combat experience where players can encounter enemies more fluidly. Consider adding random enemy spawns or quest hooks to enhance player enjoyment and deliver clear objectives that can be accomplished within the session's timeframe.

In summary, the core design around skill progression and combat mechanics must be reworked to enhance player experience significantly. With the current system, players are unlikely to remain engaged or return to the game.
