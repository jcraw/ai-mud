            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 3/10)
- Making progress toward the goal was painfully slow. The player ended the session without advancing their Dodge skill at all (still at level 4) and only received marginal experience points, hardly enough to feel impactful. 
- Pacing was frustrating. With only 12 total steps taken and a playthrough duration of nearly 144 seconds, the player spent an excessively long time seeking combat opportunities without success. 
- Progression milestones were nonexistent as the player started and ended with the same Dodge level. Experiencing even an incremental increase would enhance the feeling of progression.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Increase the spawn rate of hostile NPCs in safe zones or adjacent areas, to encourage combat more frequently. Add events or achievements related to reaching milestones within the skill tree that provide immediate feedback or small rewards upon participating in combat.

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 5/10)
- Combat engagement was one-sided and, unfortunately, not fulfilling. The player seemed to have great difficulty finding enemies willing to fight - leading to a low combat exposure which limited chances to increase the Dodge skill.
- Damage mechanics appeared imbalanced. Although the player took no damage, they also failed to engage effectively, which created a feeling of detachment from the combat system. The lack of meaningful combat participation nullified any real sense of challenge or achievement.
- Combat felt fair mechanistically, but it proved engaging only in terms of the intention behind the actions. The gameplay loop got repetitive with redundant actions (i.e., trying to attack the same enemy without effective outcomes).
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Introduce NPCs with varying levels of aggression and difficulty, and ensure the player can encounter at least some enemies within a reasonable timeframe. Adjust the combat frequency, and tweak the damage mechanics to make overcoming opponents more tangible.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 6/10)
- The overall goal of leveling the Dodge skill through combat was clear. However, the mechanics around achieving that goal were convoluted by the lack of enemies to fight, leaving the player unsure how to efficiently progress.
- Feedback on player actions was fairly clear, but there was little actionable output in response to combat attempts (no experience gain for Dodge despite repeated activations). Without tangible results from their engagement, the player's understanding of how to effectively increase their skill became muddled.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Provide clearer guidance on what actions lead to successful skill leveling and consider implementing a tutorial that clarifies skill progression mechanics early on. Include intermediate feedback throughout the combat process, like a short summary of actions that led to XP gains or losses, to positively reinforce behavior.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 4/10)
- A real player would likely find this gameplay experience frustrating and disengaging. The repetitive nature of seeking combat without succeeding dampens the fun factor significantly.
- What worked well was the underlying logic of wanting to engage with NPCs and clear motivation for progressing the Dodge skill. But the gameplay loop became stale due to the lack of meaningful interactions in combat scenarios.
- **Suggestions for Improvement**: Diversify the encounters in a meaningful way. Introduce side quests or challenges linked to combat that reward achievements, even if not directly tied to leveling Dodge. Also, consider implementing a more dynamic combat system that incorporates a wider array of enemies with diverse abilities for a more engaging experience. 

In summary, the game's current mechanics and pacing do not adequately provide players with the sense of progression, engagement, or thrill that a MUD should evoke. Immediate revisions in spawn rates, combat diversity, and clearer feedback are necessary to enhance the gameplay experience significantly.
