Ancient magical circles etched into the floor swirl around you, their intricate patterns thrumming with a life of their own, while floating arcane symbols drift lazily in the air, humming with a palpable energy that vibrates through your bones. A portal-like shimmer ripples across the far wall, hinting at secrets just beyond reach, as the atmosphere thickens with an intoxicating blend of wonder and trepidation, drawing you deeper into the unknown.\nExits: south\nYou see: Heavy Stone Door, Ancient Rune Inscription",
