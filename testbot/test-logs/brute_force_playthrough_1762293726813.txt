        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You find yourself beneath a crumbling stone archway, its edges worn smooth by time and neglect. Moss clings to the damp walls, giving the air a cool, earthy scent that mingles with the musty aroma of forgotten tales. Flickering torchlight dances across the surface, illuminating ancient runes carved into the doorframe, their meanings lost to the ages yet whispering secrets of a long-gone era. The shadows play tricks, making the dim space feel alive, as if the very stones are watching your every move.

        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, the walls looming high and enclosing you in their ancient embrace. The echo of your footsteps reverberates through the corridor, intertwining with the rhythmic drip of water that sounds like a distant heartbeat. In the corners, spider webs cling like gauzy veils, shimmering faintly in the dim light, while the worn flagstone floor beneath your feet tells tales of countless travelers who have tread this path before. A chill weaves through the musty air, brushing against your skin like a whisper, as if the shadows themselves are eager to share their secrets.

        Player: go west

        Game Master:
        Forgotten Armory
You enter the Forgotten Armory, where rusty weapon racks stand in solemn silence, their once-proud blades now dulled and forgotten. Tarnished armor stands loom like specters of ancient warriors, their metal surfaces coated in the dust of years gone by, reflecting the flickering light with a ghostly sheen. The air is thick with the smell of old leather and metal, a pungent reminder of battles fought and won, while cobwebs drape across the shields, weaving delicate tapestries of neglect. Above, ancient battle standards hang limply, their colors faded, whispering stories of glory that have long since faded into the shadows.
