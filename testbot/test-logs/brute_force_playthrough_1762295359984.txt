        Dungeon Entrance
You stand at the threshold of a foreboding dungeon, framed by a crumbling stone archway that appears to sag under the weight of time. Moss clings to the damp walls, its vibrant green contrasting with the dull gray of the stone, while flickering torchlight struggles to pierce the shadows that linger in the corners. A musty air fills your lungs, heavy with the scent of earth and decay, and your gaze is drawn to the ancient runes carved into the doorframe, whispering secrets of a forgotten era.

        Forgotten Armory
You find yourself in the Forgotten Armory, where the air is thick with a musty blend of old leather and tarnished metal. Rusty weapon racks lean precariously against the walls, their once-proud blades dulled by time and neglect, while cobwebs hang like shrouds over battered shields, guarding memories of battles long past. Ancient battle standards, faded and frayed, sway gently in an unseen draft, their colors muted yet haunting, whispering tales of glory and despair in this silent, forsaken sanctuary.
