        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a narrow stone passage, its walls closing in around you like a forgotten tomb. The sound of echoing footsteps reverberates off the damp surfaces, accompanied by the steady drip of water from unseen crevices, creating an eerie symphony of solitude. In the corners, delicate spider webs glisten faintly in the dim light, remnants of life that seem to cling to the shadows. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet feels cold and uneven, each step stirring the ancient dust of countless years.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step into the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms at the far end like a sentinel of forgotten power. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their once-vibrant colors dulled by time, whispering tales of glory now lost. The cracked marble floor stretches out beneath you, its surface cold and uneven, echoing the chill of a draft that slithers in from unseen passages. Ominous shadows dance around you, while a skeleton slumps upon the throne, a silent testament to the weight of ambition and ruin that fills this desolate space.

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You return to the abandoned throne room, a place steeped in an unsettling silence where the massive stone throne continues to dominate the scene, encased in a gloom that seems to pulsate with forgotten memories. The faded royal tapestries hang like ghostly figures, their intricate designs barely discernible, whispering remnants of a bygone majesty. A cold draft brushes against your skin, slithering through the cracks in the stone, while ominous shadows swell and recede, as if alive, around the skeleton that slumps on the throne, a grim reminder of the ambitions that once filled this hallowed hall. The cracked marble floor beneath you amplifies the room's desolation, each step unsettling the dust of ages past, leaving you to ponder the echoes of power long extinguished.
