        Abandoned Throne Room
You enter the Abandoned Throne Room, where a massive stone throne looms like a forgotten sentinel, its cold surface worn smooth by the passage of time. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their once-vibrant colors now dulled to ghostly echoes of a lost majesty. The cracked marble floor stretches beneath you, each fissure a testament to the room's long-forgotten glory, while ominous shadows twist and writhe in the flickering torchlight that barely penetrates the gloom. A cold draft whispers through unseen passages, brushing against your skin like a chilling reminder of the skeletal figure slumped upon the throne, a silent witness to the decay of power and splendor.

        Game Master:
        You approach the massive stone throne, its formidable presence dominating the room. Carved from ancient stone, its surface is rough and cold, adorned with faded etchings that speak of a once-noble lineage. The throne's high back is daunting, and its broad arms seem to cradle the weight of time itself, as if mourning the power that has long since faded. Shadows cling to it, accentuating the skeletal figure slumped in its embrace—a chilling reminder of the throne's former majesty and the decay of those who once occupied it.
