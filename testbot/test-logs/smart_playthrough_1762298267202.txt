        Player: look

        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You stand before a crumbling stone archway, its once-grand entrance now sagging beneath the weight of time and neglect. Moss-covered walls cling desperately to the edges, softening the harsh lines of the ancient structure while adding a vibrant splash of green to the somber scene. Flickering torchlight bathes the area in a ghostly glow, casting long shadows that dance across the damp stone, while the musty air, thick with the scent of earth and dampness, envelops you like a heavy shroud. Intricate runes, worn by the ages, are carved deep into the doorframe, whispering secrets of forgotten magic and long-lost tales.
Exits: north

        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, where the air feels thick with the weight of silence. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet echoes with each step, the sound reverberating through the dimness like a distant memory. Water drips incessantly from unseen crevices, the rhythmic plink adding a haunting melody to the stillness, while spider webs cling in the corners, their delicate strands glistening like threads of silver in the faint light. Shadows loom heavily, whispering secrets of those who have come before you, as you venture deeper into the unknown.

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You enter the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms at the far end, its imposing presence both regal and grotesque. Faded royal tapestries hang limply on the cracked walls, their once-vibrant colors now mere ghosts of glory, whispering tales of a long-forgotten reign. The cold draft swirling through unseen passages carries with it an unsettling chill, as ominous shadows stretch and contract, playing tricks on your senses. Slumped upon the throne, a skeleton sits in eternal silence, a stark reminder of the fleeting nature of power, while the cracked marble floor beneath your feet feels as if it could crumble at any moment, echoing the decay of this once-grand hall.

        Hidden Chamber
You step into a hidden chamber illuminated by fantastical crystal formations that cast a kaleidoscope of colors across the stone walls. Ancient magical circles, etched deep into the floor, pulse with a soft glow, their intricate designs whispering secrets of arcane power long forgotten. Floating symbols swirl in the air, humming with an energy that vibrates through your very bones, while a portal-like shimmer beckons enticingly from the far wall, hinting at mysteries waiting to be unveiled. The atmosphere feels charged, alive with the potential of magic, as if the very air around you anticipates your next move.
