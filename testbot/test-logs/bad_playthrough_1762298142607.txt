        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a narrow stone passage, the air thick with the chill of dampness. The sound of your echoing footsteps reverberates against the walls, creating a haunting symphony punctuated by the distant drip of water, each drop a reminder of the unseen depths beyond. In the corners, delicate spider webs glisten faintly in the dim light, their intricate patterns a testament to the passage of time, while the worn flagstone floor beneath your feet bears the weight of countless journeys taken before you.

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step into the abandoned throne room, the air thick with an unsettling stillness that wraps around you like a shroud. The massive stone throne looms at the far end, its surface worn smooth by the weight of countless dreams and despair, while faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their colors bleached by time. Shadows dance ominously in the flickering torchlight, revealing a skeleton slumped upon the throne, a ghostly reminder of a kingdom long forgotten. A cold draft whispers through unseen passages, sending a shiver down your spine as you take in the cracked marble floor beneath you, each fissure a scar of history etched in stone.

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step back into the abandoned throne room, the air heavy with a palpable tension that clings to your skin. The massive stone throne, a relic of power, looms like a silent sentinel, its cold surface marked by the touch of decay, while the faded royal tapestries hang like ghostly veils, their once-vibrant colors muted by the relentless passage of time. Shadows dart and flicker menacingly across the cracked marble floor, giving life to the eerie stillness, and the chilling draft that sweeps through the room carries with it whispers of forgotten secrets. Atop the throne, the lifeless skeleton stares into the void, a haunting reminder of ambition and ruin entwined in a dance as old as the stones themselves.
Exits: south, north
