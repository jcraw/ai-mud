        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a narrow stone passage, the walls pressing in as if to whisper secrets long forgotten. The sound of your footsteps echoes ominously, mingling with the rhythmic drip of water from unseen crevices, creating a haunting melody. In the corners, delicate spider webs glisten like fine lace in the dim light, while the worn flagstone floor bears the scuff marks of countless travelers, each step adding to the passageâ€™s storied past.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step into the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms, its surface worn and etched with the remnants of a regal past. Faded royal tapestries hang from the walls, their once-vibrant colors now muted under layers of dust, whispering tales of glory and betrayal. The cracked marble floor stretches beneath your feet like a forgotten battlefield, each fissure casting ominous shadows that seem to flicker and dance with unsettling life. A cold draft winds through the chamber, carrying the faint scent of decay, and your gaze is drawn to a skeletal figure slumped upon the throne, a silent guardian of this forsaken realm.
Exits: south, north
You see: Skeleton King

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You return to the abandoned throne room, where the massive stone throne looms even more imposing in the dim light. The faded royal tapestries sway slightly, hinting at a life long extinguished, their once-proud motifs now ghostly echoes of a forgotten lineage. The cracked marble floor feels cold beneath your feet, each crevice casting ominous shadows that stretch and writhe like dark phantoms. A chill draft sweeps through the air, carrying with it the stale scent of time, as your eyes settle once more on the skeletal figure slumped upon the throne, a grim reminder of the power that once resided here.
Exits: south, north
You see: Skeleton King

        Validation: PASS
