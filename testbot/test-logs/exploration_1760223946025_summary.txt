        STEP DETAILS
        ================================================================================

        Step 1: ✓ PASS
Input: look around
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 2: ✗ FAIL
Input: go north
Reason: The GM response does not indicate a successful movement to a new room, as it repeats the same room name 'Dark Corridor' without showing a new description.

Step 3: ✓ PASS
Input: look at the walls
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 4: ✓ PASS
Input: go south
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 5: ✗ FAIL
Input: go east
Reason: The player attempted to move east, but the response indicates that this direction is not valid, which contradicts the expected outcome of moving to a new room.

Step 6: ✓ PASS
Input: look around
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 7: ✗ FAIL
Input: go north
Reason: The response indicates the same room name without confirming movement, which is inconsistent with the expected outcome.

Step 8: ✗ FAIL
Input: look at the walls
Reason: The response does not provide new information about the walls or reveal hidden features or items as expected.

Step 9: ✗ FAIL
Input: go south
Reason: The response incorrectly describes the Dungeon Entrance again instead of acknowledging the player's movement back from the Dark Corridor.

Step 10: ✗ FAIL
Input: go east
Reason: The player attempted to move east but was incorrectly told they can't go that way, despite the game state indicating valid movement options.

Step 11: ✗ FAIL
Input: go north
Reason: The response indicates the player is still in the Dark Corridor after attempting to move north, but the input suggests movement should have occurred.

Step 12: ✗ FAIL
Input: look around
Reason: The response does not provide a new or varied description for the 'look around' command, repeating the previous room description without any additional details.

Step 13: ✗ FAIL
Input: go south
Reason: The player attempted to go south from the Dark Corridor, but the response indicated they were in the Dungeon Entrance, which is inconsistent with the previous room state.

Step 14: ✗ FAIL
Input: go north
Reason: The player attempted to go north from the Dungeon Entrance but was returned to the Dark Corridor without a change in description, which violates the expectation of varying descriptions for already explored areas.

Step 15: ✓ PASS
Input: look at the walls
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 16: ✓ PASS
Input: go south
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 17: ✗ FAIL

Step 19: ✓ PASS
Input: look around
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 20: ✗ FAIL
