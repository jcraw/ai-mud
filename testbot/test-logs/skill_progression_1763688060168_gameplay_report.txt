            # PROGRESSION FEEDBACK (Score: 2/10)
The progression toward leveling the Dodge skill was severely lacking in this scenario. The player started with a Dodge level of 0 and ended with a Dodge level of 0, failing to achieve the goal of reaching Dodge level 10. The overall progression felt stagnant due to the limited ability to gain experience, meaning the goal was not met.

**Pacing**: The pacing of progression was far too slow and led to frustration. Achieving a skill level through combat should inherently provide a clear path to improvement, yet in this case, the player never accumulated any Dodge XP despite engaging in combat multiple times.

**Milestones**: There were no progression milestones or moments of satisfaction during the playthrough, primarily because the player did not achieve any level-ups. This resulted in an empty feeling regarding the skill progression system.

**Suggestions for Improvement**: Introduce a more rewarding experience curve for acquiring Dodge XP during combat. For instance, consider allowing for a minimum amount of Dodge XP to be gained with each successful block, dodge, or whenever the player is hit. Also, ensure that combat encounters are designed to yield variable experience points based on player engagement or creativity during combat (e.g., evasion, counter-attacks).

# COMBAT BALANCE (Score: 4/10)
The combat balance was a mixed experience that negatively impacted the overall gameplay. Encounters were not the right difficulty, leading to issues with functionality and engagement.

**Ease of Fights**: While the encounters started well with the Shambling Zombie and later transitioned into fighting Giant Rats, the lack of health mechanics and risk associated with their attacks undermined combat's significance. The player had no risk of dying initially, yet the sudden defeat against the Giant Rat led to a lack of gradual learning or challenge.

**Damage Balance**: Damage dealt by the enemies seemed reasonable, but the absence of player-level interactions or skills made the engagement one-sided. Being defeated without any chance for a comeback was frustrating and disheartening for the user.

**Fairness and Engagement**: Combat felt unbalanced; the player seemed to lack adequate means to defend themselves effectively or utilize skills that could have avoided damage. There were instances where tactical choices could have enabled the player to dodge attacks, but a lack of engagement left no room for strategy. 

**Suggestions for Improvement**: Create a more engaging combat system where dodge mechanics are actively rewarding—perhaps providing a small defense boost or skill points upon taking hits from enemies. Include more varied combat options to increase strategy, such as using environmental objects to gain advantages. Balance “critical hit” chances and introduce gradual injury mechanisms.

# CLARITY OF MECHANICS (Score: 5/10)
The mechanics were somewhat clear but required refinement for better player understanding and engagement.

**Achieving Goals**: Players can grasp their goal of leveling up their Dodge skill, but the means to achieve it were not clearly delineated within the game, leading to possible confusion about effective strategies.

**Feedback Clarity**: Feedback when engaging in combat, such as using “skills” and understanding how to progress, felt distant and unhelpful. The player was often met with vague instructions that did not motivate further engagement.

**Improvement Suggestions**: Provide explicit descriptions of the Dodge skill mechanics and introduce clearer triggering events for skill progression. Establish better feedback regarding progress, such as notifying the player of nearing level-ups or "hey, you dodged successfully!" using a success/failure metric that indicates how they can improve.

# OVERALL ENJOYMENT (Score: 3/10)
The overall enjoyment of this playthrough was diminished by the lack of progression, unclear mechanics, and imbalanced encounters.

**Player Engagement**: A real player might feel frustrated and disengaged due to the repetitive nature of combat and lack of meaningful progression or clear objectives. The player was left feeling as though their actions had no impact.

**What Worked Well**: The approach of engaging in battles to advance skills is a solid concept but needs better execution. The environment and interactive aspects of the dungeons provided some immersion.

**What Didn't Work**: Failing to gain any Dodge skill over the course of the scenario was discouraging. Coupled with an abrupt game over due to being outnumbered without adequate means of defense, this resulted in a negative experience.

**Suggestions for Improvement**: Increase player agency by providing clearer guidance on how to improve skills effectively, incorporating a tutorial or hints for newcomers about best practices. Additionally, create more engaging storytelling or side-objectives that create a sense of attachment to the gameplay rather than strictly focused on leveling skills. 

In conclusion, consider a thorough review of the combat system, progression mechanics, and clarity of objectives as it seems these areas are in dire need of improvement for a more enjoyable experience.
