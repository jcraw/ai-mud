        Player: look around

        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You stand before a crumbling stone archway, its weathered edges softened by time and the embrace of moss that clings to the walls. Flickering torchlight spills into the dimness, illuminating the ancient runes carved deep into the doorframe, their meanings lost to history. The musty air swirls around you, rich with the scent of damp earth and secrets long buried, inviting you to venture deeper into the unknown.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, the walls seemingly closing in around you, their rough surfaces echoing the faint sound of your footsteps. The air is thick with dampness, punctuated by the rhythmic dripping of water somewhere in the shadows, each drop a reminder of the passage of time. In the corners, spider webs hang like tattered curtains, glistening in the sparse light and whispering tales of neglect. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet feels cool and uneven, as if it bears the weight of countless travelers who have tread this path before you.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step into the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms like a forgotten relic of power. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the crumbling walls, their once-vibrant colors now mere ghosts of glory, while ominous shadows cling to the corners, hinting at secrets best left undisturbed. The cracked marble floor stretches beneath you, cool to the touch and littered with dust, as a cold draft whispers through unseen passages, carrying with it the faintest echo of a long-lost court. Slumped upon the throne, a skeletal figure sits in eternal silence, its hollow gaze seemingly surveying the remnants of a kingdom that has fallen into despair.

        Player: look at the throne

        Game Master:
        You approach the massive stone throne, its formidable presence dominating the room. The surface is rough and pitted, evidence of years of neglect, while intricate carvings, now faded and chipped, tell stories of a once-mighty ruler. Slumped upon it, the skeletal figure of a king remains, draped in tattered remnants of regal attire, forever guarding the silence and shadows that envelop the throne room.
