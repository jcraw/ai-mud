        Dungeon Entrance

Flickering torchlight illuminates the intricate ancient runes carved into the doorframe, casting ethereal shadows that seem to whisper secrets of a forgotten era. A sense of foreboding hangs in the air, as if the very stones are alive with stories waiting to be uncovered.

        Forgotten Armory
You enter the Forgotten Armory, a realm steeped in the echoes of valor and sacrifice. Rusty weapon racks sag beneath the weight of long-forgotten blades, while tarnished armor stands loom like silent sentinels, their surfaces mottled and worn. The smell of old leather and metal fills the air, mingling with the musty scent of dust that has settled into every crevice. Cobwebs drape lazily over the shields, their once-gleaming surfaces now dulled by time, and ancient battle standards hang limply from the walls, their faded colors whispering tales of glories lost to the ages.
