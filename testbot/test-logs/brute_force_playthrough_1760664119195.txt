        Dungeon Entrance
You approach a crumbling stone archway, its once-grand form now draped in a vibrant tapestry of moss that clings tenaciously to the damp walls. Flickering torchlight spills from within, illuminating the ancient runes carved into the doorframe, their meanings long forgotten but steeped in secrets. The musty air wraps around you like a shroud, thick with the scent of earth and time, drawing you deeper into the shadows that lie beyond.

Spider webs cling in the corners, their gossamer threads shimmering faintly in the low light, while the worn flagstone floor beneath your feet feels uneven and cool, a testament to the countless footsteps that have traversed this eerie path before you.

The air is thick with the scent of old leather and metal, a pungent reminder of the warriors who once donned these relics. Cobwebs drape over the shields, their delicate strands catching the faint light, while ancient battle standards hang limply, their colors faded but still hinting at the glory that once filled this hallowed space.
