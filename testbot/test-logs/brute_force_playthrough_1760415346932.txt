        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You find yourself beneath a dimly lit archway formed by crumbling stone, the weight of the ages palpable in the air. Moss clings to the damp walls, its vibrant green a stark contrast to the gray of the stones, while flickering torchlight dances across intricate ancient runes carved into the doorframe, whispering secrets of a long-lost time. The musty air wraps around you like an old cloak, thick with the scent of earth and forgotten memories, drawing you deeper into the shadows beyond.

        Dark Corridor
You step into a dark corridor, the narrow stone passage wrapping around you like a constricting embrace. The echoing footsteps of your own tread bounce off the walls, a haunting reminder of solitude in this forgotten place. Water drips rhythmically from unseen cracks above, punctuating the silence with an unsettling metronome, while cobwebs cling in the corners like ghostly tendrils guarding secrets untold. The worn flagstone floor, slick with age, shifts beneath your feet, whispering stories of those who have wandered this way before.

        Forgotten Armory
You enter the Forgotten Armory, where the air is thick with the scent of old leather and tarnished metal, each breath laden with the weight of forgotten battles. Rusty weapon racks lean precariously against crumbling walls, their once-glorious armaments long surrendered to the relentless passage of time. Cobwebs drape over shields like spectral veils, and ancient battle standards hang limply, their vibrant hues dulled by the years, whispering tales of valor and sacrifice. Shadows dance in the dim light, creating an atmosphere heavy with the echoes of clashing steel and the lingering spirits of warriors long gone.

        Dark Corridor
You step deeper into the dark corridor, where the narrow stone passage constricts around you like a chilling embrace. Each echoing footstep reverberates off the damp walls, a spectral reminder of your isolation in this forsaken place. The persistent drip of water from above punctuates the eerie silence, creating an unsettling rhythm that melds with the faint rustle of spider webs in the corners, their silken strands shimmering like ghostly threads in the dim light. The worn flagstone floor, slick and uneven, feels as though it holds the weight of countless souls who have tread this path before, whispering their secrets into the shadows.

You enter the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms at the far end like a sentinel of lost glory. Faded royal tapestries sag on the walls, their once-vibrant colors now muted, weaving a story of grandeur now reduced to shadows. The cracked marble floor stretches beneath you, cold and unforgiving, while an eerie draft snakes through the room from unseen passages, sending a shiver across your skin. In the flickering light, a skeleton slumps upon the throne, its empty gaze seeming to watch with an eternal sorrow, as ominous shadows dance around, flickering like the remnants of a court long forgotten.
