The cracked marble floor, cold to the touch, mirrors the chill that seeps through the room from unseen passages, while ominous shadows stretch across the space, forming distorted shapes that dance in the flickering light. A skeleton, slumped in regal repose upon the throne, serves as a chilling sentinel, an echo of the authority that once ruled here.\nExits: south, north\nYou see: Skeleton King",
