        Player: look

        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You find yourself beneath a crumbling stone archway, the weight of time pressing down upon you. Moss-covered walls cling to the dampness, their vibrant green contrasting sharply with the dull gray stone. Flickering torchlight struggles to illuminate the space, casting erratic shadows that dance among the ancient runes carved into the doorframe, whispering forgotten secrets. The air is thick with a musty scent, suffused with the essence of ages long gone, wrapping around you like a shroud.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, the air cool and damp against your skin. Your footsteps echo eerily, a haunting reminder of your solitude as they bounce off the rough-hewn walls. The faint sound of dripping water creates a rhythmic cadence, mingling with the silence, while tattered spider webs cling to the corners, shimmering like ghostly veils in the feeble light. Beneath your feet, the worn flagstone floor feels uneven and ancient, each step a reminder of the countless souls who have traversed this dim corridor before you.
Exits: south, east, west, north

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You enter the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms like a forgotten sentinel amidst the decay. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their once-vibrant colors now muted by dust and time, telling tales of glory long lost. The cracked marble floor, cold beneath your feet, is an unsettling mosaic of shadows that seem to stretch and twist, as if alive in the flickering light. A chilling draft whispers through unseen passages, carrying with it the scent of neglect and decay, while the sight of a skeleton, slumped upon the throne, serves as a grim reminder of the fate that befell those who once reigned here.
Exits: south, north
You see: Skeleton King

        Validation: PASS

        Player: intimidate Skeleton King

        Game Master:
        Failed! The Skeleton King laughs, a hollow rattling sound. 'You dare threaten ME? Foolish mortal!' His hostility intensifies.

        Validation: PASS
Reason: [CODE] Intimidation check failed on 'Skeleton King' (dice roll lost, mechanics work. Flavor text about hostility/consequences is normal for failed intimidation)
