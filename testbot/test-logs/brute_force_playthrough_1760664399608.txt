        Dungeon Entrance
You stand before a crumbling stone archway, its edges eroded by time and the relentless grasp of nature. Moss clings to the damp walls, softening the harshness of the stone with its vibrant green, while flickering torchlight dances across the ancient runes carved deep into the doorframe, whispering secrets of forgotten lore. The musty air is thick with the scent of damp earth and decay, wrapping around you like a heavy shroud as you contemplate the darkness that lies beyond.

You enter the Forgotten Armory, where the remnants of past glories lie shrouded in shadows. Rusty weapon racks sag under the weight of forgotten arms, their once-gleaming surfaces now dulled by time and neglect. Tarnished armor stands, adorned with cobwebs, loom like silent sentinels, their ghostly forms preserving the scent of old leather and metal that hangs thick in the air. Ancient battle standards, tattered and faded, flutter softly in a draft that whispers tales of long-forgotten conflicts, filling the room with an eerie sense of nostalgia and loss.
