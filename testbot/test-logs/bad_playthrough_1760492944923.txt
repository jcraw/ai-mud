        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a narrow stone passage, where the air feels cool and damp against your skin. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet echoes with each step, the sound bouncing off the walls and mingling with the distant drip of water, creating a haunting melody. In the shadows, spider webs cling to the corners, their silken threads shimmering faintly in the dim light, a testament to the stillness that pervades this forgotten corridor.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You enter the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms at the center, a relic of power now draped in an unsettling stillness. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their once-vibrant colors dulled by time, whispering tales of glory long forgotten. The cracked marble floor, littered with dust and debris, sends a chill through the air, as an ominous draft dances in from unseen passages, carrying echoes of the past. In a haunting tableau, a skeleton slumps motionless upon the throne, its empty gaze fixed on the shadows that creep across the chamber, as if guarding the remnants of a lost kingdom.
Exits: south, north

        Player: look

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You stand in the abandoned throne room, where the massive stone throne dominates the space, a formidable reminder of authority now surrendered to decay. Faded royal tapestries hang like ghostly figures from the walls, their intricate designs barely visible beneath layers of dust, while the cracked marble floor beneath your feet feels both cold and unforgiving. Ominous shadows flicker in the corners, sentinels of a forgotten era, as a chilling draft snakes through the chamber, carrying with it whispers of long-lost secrets. There, upon the throne, a skeleton slumps in eternal vigil, its hollow sockets seemingly surveying the remnants of a kingdom swallowed by time.
Exits: south, north
You see: Skeleton King

        Validation: PASS
Reason: The combat initiated correctly with the Skeleton King, and the damage dealt was reasonable, leading to the player's death as expected.
