        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a narrow stone passage that stretches into shadow, the walls closing in around you. Every step you take reverberates in the confined space, echoing like a distant heartbeat, while the faint sound of dripping water adds an unsettling rhythm to the silence. Spider webs cling in the corners, their delicate strands shimmering in the dim light, and the worn flagstone floor tells tales of countless travelers who have tread this path before you. The air feels damp and heavy, as if it carries the weight of secrets long forgotten.

Ornate treasure chests, intricately carved and adorned, stand sentinel around the room, while jeweled artifacts rest upon pedestals, their vibrant colors catching the eye. A magical aura tingles in the air, and dust motes dance gracefully in a shaft of light that pierces through a narrow opening above, adding to the sense of wonder that envelops you.
