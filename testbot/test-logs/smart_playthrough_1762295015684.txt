        Player: look at entrance

        Game Master:
        You focus on the entrance itself, a crumbling stone archway that looms before you, its weathered edges softened by the passage of time. The vibrant green moss clings to the damp stones, adding a splash of life to the ancient structure, while the flickering torchlight from within dances along the surfaces, revealing the intricate details of the ancient runes carved into the doorframe. It feels as though this entrance is not just a passageway but a gateway to forgotten stories and hidden dangers.

        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, where the walls loom like ancient sentinels, their surfaces slick with moisture. The rhythmic sound of dripping water punctuates the silence, each droplet echoing like a distant reminder of time's relentless passage. Spider webs cling to the corners, fragile lacework that shimmers in the dim light, while the worn flagstone floor beneath your feet tells stories of countless travelers who have traversed this path before you. A chill weaves through the musty air, wrapping around you like an unwelcome embrace as you delve deeper into the heart of the dungeon.

        Abandoned Throne Room
You enter the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms in the center, its once-majestic form now marred by time. Faded royal tapestries hang limply on the cracked marble walls, their vibrant colors long surrendered to the relentless grip of decay. An ominous cold draft sweeps through the chamber, whispering secrets from unseen passages, while shadows flicker and twist, casting eerie shapes that dance along the floor. Slumped upon the throne is a skeleton, a remnant of royalty, forever entombed in this desolate domain, as if serving as a warning to all who dare to claim the power that once reigned here.

        Player: look at the throne

        Game Master:
        You approach the massive stone throne, its imposing presence dominating the center of the abandoned room. The cold surface is rough to the touch, with intricate carvings worn nearly smooth by time, telling stories of a regal past now shrouded in dust. The shadows play across its form, highlighting the throne's grandeur, while its undeniable weight signifies the burden of power once wielded here, now merely a grim seat for the skeleton slumped upon it.

        Hidden Chamber
You step into a hidden chamber, where the air thrums with an otherworldly energy that vibrates against your skin. Mysteriously lit crystal formations jut from the ground, their radiant hues illuminating the ancient magical circles etched into the stone floor, whispering tales of forgotten rituals. Floating arcane symbols drift languidly through the space, pulsating with a life of their own, while a shimmering portal-like glow dances enticingly on the far wall, hinting at realms unknown. The atmosphere is thick with anticipation, as if the very fabric of reality holds its breath, waiting for your next decision.
