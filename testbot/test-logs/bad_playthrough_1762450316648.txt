        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a narrow stone passage, where the walls loom ominously close, their dampness seeping into the very air you breathe. Each step you take sends an echo ricocheting off the cold stones, mingling with the rhythmic drip of water that punctuates the silence. In the corners, delicate spider webs shimmer faintly, remnants of a life that once thrived in the shadows. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet bears the weight of countless travelers, whispering their secrets of long-lost journeys.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You emerge into the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms like a forgotten sentinel amidst the decay. Faded royal tapestries, once vibrant, now hang limply on the cracked marble walls, their colors muted by time's relentless grasp. The air is chilled by a draft that sweeps through unseen passages, causing the ominous shadows to flicker and stretch across the floor, where a skeleton slumps lifelessly, a ghostly reminder of power lost. A profound silence wraps around you, broken only by the distant echo of your own breath, as if the very room holds its breath in anticipation.

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step back into the abandoned throne room, the massive stone throne dominating the space like a relic of fallen majesty. Faded royal tapestries drape the walls, their once resplendent colors now ghosts of glory, while the cracked marble floor feels cold and unyielding beneath your feet. An unsettling draft swirls around you, stirring the ominous shadows that cling to the corners, where the skeleton slumped on the throne seems to watch, a silent witness to the echoes of power now draped in silence. The air is thick with an ancient chill, as if the very essence of forgotten royalty lingers, waiting for a moment to awaken.
