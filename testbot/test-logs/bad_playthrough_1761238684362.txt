        Player: look

        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You find yourself beneath a crumbling stone archway, its rough edges softened by patches of moss that cling tenaciously to the walls. Flickering torchlight drapes the space in a wavering glow, illuminating the ancient runes carved into the doorframe, their meanings long forgotten yet echoing with power. The musty air is thick and stale, carrying the scent of damp earth and secrets long buried.
Exits: north
You see: Old Guard

        Validation: PASS

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, the weight of the ancient walls pressing in around you. Each footfall echoes through the corridor, a haunting reminder of your solitude, while the persistent sound of dripping water reverberates in the stillness. In the dimness, spider webs stretch across the corners like delicate lace, their silken threads glistening with moisture. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet feels cool and uneven, each step whispering tales of those who have traversed this path before you.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You enter the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms like a forgotten relic of power, its grandeur diminished by the passage of time. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their once-vibrant colors now muted and dulled, fluttering slightly in the cold draft that snakes through unseen passages. The cracked marble floor stretches before you, its surface marred with age and neglect, while ominous shadows swirl in the flickering light, intertwining with the lifeless form of a skeleton slumped upon the throne, a silent witness to the echoes of glory long past. The air carries a chill that penetrates to the bone, laden with the weight of history and the whispers of lost sovereignty.
