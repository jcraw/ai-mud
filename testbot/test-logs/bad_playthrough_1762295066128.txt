        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a narrow stone passage, its walls closing in around you like a long-forgotten tomb. The echoing footsteps reverberate ominously, mingling with the distant sound of water dripping from unseen crevices, creating a haunting melody of solitude. Shadows cling to the corners, where thick spider webs hang like ghostly veils, and the worn flagstone floor beneath your feet tells tales of countless travelers who have passed this way before.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step into the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms regally against the far wall, its surface encrusted with dust and memories of a forgotten reign. Faded royal tapestries, once vibrant with tales of glory, now hang limp and lifeless, their colors muted by the passage of time. The cracked marble floor, a patchwork of white and gray, whispers underfoot, while an ominous draft snakes through the chamber from unseen passages, carrying with it the chill of neglect. In the flickering shadows, you catch a glimpse of a skeleton slumped on the throne, a silent sentinel of the past, watching over this desolate realm.
Exits: south, north
You see: Skeleton King
