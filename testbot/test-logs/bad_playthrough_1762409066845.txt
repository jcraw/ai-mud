        Dark Corridor
You find yourself in a dark corridor, its narrow stone passage pressing in from both sides. The echo of your footsteps reverberates against the cold walls, mingling with the rhythmic drip of water that punctuates the silence. In the corners, delicate spider webs stretch like gossamer veils, their occupants lying in wait, while the worn flagstone floor beneath you bears the weight of countless travelers before you. The air is thick with an eerie stillness, heightening your senses as you venture deeper into the unknown.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step into the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms at the far end, a stark testament to a forgotten power. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their colors dulled by time, whispering tales of grandeur long lost. The cracked marble floor, littered with dust and debris, echoes each step you take, while ominous shadows creep along the edges, as if watching your every move. A cold draft weaves through the chamber, sending a shiver down your spine, and you catch the scent of decay mingling with the chill, drawing your gaze to the skeletal figure slumped upon the throne, an eerie sentinel of this forsaken place.

        Player: look

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You return to the abandoned throne room, where the massive stone throne still dominates the space, its surface cold and unyielding beneath your fingertips. The faded royal tapestries flutter slightly, revealing ghostly images of a past grandeur—now just echoes of nobility lost to time. The cracked marble floor, once a symbol of opulence, groans softly underfoot, while ominous shadows pulse and stretch in the flickering light, as if the room itself holds its breath. A chilling draft sweeps through, carrying with it the scent of decay, and your eyes are drawn once more to the skeleton on the throne, an unsettling reminder of the power that once reigned here and the silence that now envelops this forsaken hall.
Exits: south, north

        Validation: PASS
