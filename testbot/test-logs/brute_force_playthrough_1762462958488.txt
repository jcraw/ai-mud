        Dungeon Entrance
You stand before a crumbling stone archway, its once-mighty frame now sagging under the weight of time. The walls, cloaked in a thick carpet of moss, exude a dampness that mingles with the musty air, creating an oppressive atmosphere. Flickering torchlight struggles to penetrate the dimness, illuminating ancient runes carved into the doorframe, whispering secrets of a long-forgotten past. Shadows dance around you, and an eerie stillness settles, as if the very stones hold their breath in anticipation.

The rhythmic sound of dripping water punctuates the silence, while spider webs cling to the corners, their silken threads glistening like ghostly veils in the faint light. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet feels uneven and cool, resonating with the weight of countless steps taken before you, as if the very stones are whispering tales of those who once tread here.

Tarnished armor stands loom like silent sentinels, their surfaces marred by time and neglect, while cobwebs drape over shields like ghostly shrouds. Above you, ancient battle standards hang limply, their faded colors hinting at legendary conflicts that echo in the silence, each thread woven with stories that reverberate through the ages.
