        Player: look at entrance

        Game Master:
        You examine the dungeon entrance closely, noting the crumbling stone archway that frames it. The once-grand structure shows signs of age and decay, with jagged edges and the moss that clings to it giving the impression that nature is gradually reclaiming this place. The flickering torchlight casts eerie shadows across the entrance, inviting yet ominous, as the ancient runes carved into the doorframe seem to murmur secrets of long-lost tales.

        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, the walls closing in around you with a suffocating embrace. Echoing footsteps reverberate off the damp surfaces, mingling with the steady drip of water that punctuates the heavy silence. Shadowy corners are adorned with intricate spider webs, their delicate threads glistening faintly in the flickering light. The worn flagstone floor beneath your feet feels cool and uneven, each step stirring the musty air that carries the weight of forgotten stories.

        Game Master:
        Abandoned Throne Room
You step into the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms like a ghost of authority, its once-proud contours now draped in the dust of neglect. Faded royal tapestries cling to the walls, their vibrant colors drained into muted shadows that ripple in the dim light cast by an unseen source. The cracked marble floor, littered with fragments of forgotten grandeur, sends a chill through your bones as a cold draft whispers from unseen passages, carrying with it a sense of foreboding. In the corner of your eye, a skeleton slumps on the throne, an eerie reminder of power lost to time, while ominous shadows stretch and twist, inviting both reverence and dread.

        Hidden Chamber
You step into a hidden chamber where mysteriously lit crystal formations rise from the ground like ethereal guardians, their soft glow bathing the space in otherworldly hues. Ancient magical circles etched into the stone floor pulse with a faint rhythm, echoing the hum of arcane energy that fills the air. Floating symbols drift lazily above you, their intricate designs shimmering and shifting, as if alive with secrets waiting to be unveiled. A portal-like shimmer shimmers in the far wall, beckoning you with the promise of untold destinies, while the atmosphere crackles with the anticipation of ancient magic stirring once more.
