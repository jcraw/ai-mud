You stand in the Town, a safe haven carved from the dungeon depths.
Torches flicker on stone walls, casting dancing shadows. Merchants display their wares on
rickety stalls, calling out to passing adventurers. The air is warm and smells of bread,
metal, and brewing potions. Weary travelers rest on benches, sharing tales of the depths below.
This is a place of respite - no danger reaches here.

        Reasoning: The next objective is to go to the armory, which is located to the west from the corridor. Since I am currently in the Emberforge Crossroads and need to navigate to the armory, moving north to the corridor and then making the subsequent turn west is the logical next step to complete the objectives.

        Reasoning: To progress through the dungeon and reach the armory, I need to navigate from the current location to the corridor and then west towards the armory. Since I have already explored multiple areas and the exits available are south, east, and southwest, I will first go east as it seems to lead toward the corridor where the armory is located.
Player: go east

        Game Master:
        DODGE LOADED FROM DB [test_player]: level=0, xp=20/100

        Reasoning: I need to follow the path towards the armory to collect the best weapon available. Since I am currently in the Molten Echo Chamber, the next step is to move back southwest to reach the corridor that leads to the armory. This action is critical to ensure I equip myself with superior gear before facing any enemies.
Player: go southwest

        Game Master:
        DODGE LOADED FROM DB [test_player]: level=0, xp=20/100
