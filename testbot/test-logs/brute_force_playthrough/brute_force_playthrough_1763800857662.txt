        Reasoning: The next step in my objectives is to move to the armory to collect the best weapon available.

        [2025-11-22T08:41:13.390176164Z]

        Reasoning: I need to collect the best weapon to prepare for the upcoming boss fight. Since I am currently in the Dark Corridor and the Forgotten Armory is to the west, my next logical step is to take the best weapon from the armory. The best weapon is the Rusty Iron Sword, which I haven't collected yet. Therefore, I will check the armory for the weapon.
Player: go west

        Game Master:
        You take the Red Health Potion.

I have already taken the Red Health Potion in the previous actions, but since it is still in my inventory, I need to ensure that I have noted that I have taken the required health potion. This will help in future actions involving healing, and it's an important part of my preparation before facing the Skeleton King.
