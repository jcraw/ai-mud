        Player: look

        Game Master:
        Dungeon Entrance
You stand before a crumbling stone archway, its edges softened by time and draped in patches of moss that cling stubbornly to the walls. Flickering torchlight dances upon the ancient runes carved into the doorframe, illuminating their mysterious symbols and hinting at secrets long forgotten. The air feels thick with a musty weight, swirling with the scent of damp earth and age, as if the very stones are whispering tales of those who once tread here.

        Player: go north

        Game Master:
        Dark Corridor
You step into a narrow stone passage, the walls closing in around you like a forgotten tomb. Your footsteps echo ominously off the damp stone, mingling with the distant sound of water dripping steadily, a metronome marking the passage of time in this forsaken place. Cobwebs cling to the corners, their delicate threads shimmering like ghostly veils in the dim light, while the worn flagstone floor beneath your feet bears the weight of countless journeys, each one etched into its surface. The air is cool and heavy, carrying an unsettling stillness that sends a shiver down your spine.
