        Abandoned Throne Room
You enter the abandoned throne room, where a massive stone throne looms at the far end, its once-majestic form now draped in the shadows of time. Faded royal tapestries cling to the walls, their colors long lost, whispering secrets of a forgotten reign. The cracked marble floor, cool beneath your feet, echoes with a chilling draft that sneaks in from unseen passages, as if the very air mourns the solitude of this desolate space. In the flickering light, a skeletal figure slumps on the throne, a haunting reminder of power long faded into oblivion.

The cracked marble floor feels cold and unyielding beneath you, while an unsettling draft whispers through the space, stirring the ominous shadows that cling to every corner. The skeletal figure slumped upon the throne gazes emptily into the void, a chilling reminder of the once-great ruler whose reign has crumbled into silence.
