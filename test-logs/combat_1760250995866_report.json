Ominous shadows dance in the corners, stretching and retracting as if alive, while a cold draft sneaks through the room, stirring the dust like whispers of lost souls. The skeletal figure slumped on the throne seems to watch over the desolation with hollow eye sockets, a grim reminder of the power that once ruled here.\nExits: south, north\nYou see: Skeleton King",
