        STEP DETAILS
        ================================================================================

        Step 1: ✓ PASS
Input: look around
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 2: ✗ FAIL
Input: go north
Reason: The response does not provide a new room description after the player moves north, instead repeating the previous room description.

Step 3: ✗ FAIL
Input: look around
Reason: The room description for 'look around' in the Dark Corridor is repetitive and does not introduce new information or variability, despite being coherent.

Step 4: ✗ FAIL
Input: go south
Reason: The player attempted to go south but was returned to the Dungeon Entrance without an error message, indicating a failure in movement mechanics.

Step 5: ✗ FAIL
Input: go east
Reason: The response does not provide a new room description or appropriate information for the player's action.

Step 6: ✓ PASS
Input: look at the stone archway
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 7: ✗ FAIL
Input: look around
Reason: The response does not provide a detailed description of the Dungeon Entrance as expected and repeats the previous description without adding new information.

Step 8: ✗ FAIL
Input: go north
Reason: The response does not indicate whether the player can move north and instead repeats the current room description without acknowledging the movement.

Step 9: ✗ FAIL
Input: look at the moss on the walls
Reason: The response does not provide a description of the moss, which is expected based on the player's input.

Step 10: ✗ FAIL
Input: look down
Reason: The response to 'look down' is not appropriate as it fails to provide any description of the floor, which is expected.

Step 11: ✗ FAIL
Input: go south
Reason: The response indicates the player is still at the Dungeon Entrance after attempting to go south, which is not valid as there are no exits to the south.

Step 12: ✗ FAIL
Input: go east
Reason: The response does not reflect a valid movement option and fails to provide a new room description.

Step 13: ✓ PASS
Input: look around
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 14: ✗ FAIL
Input: go north
Reason: The response indicates the player is still in the Dark Corridor despite attempting to go north, which suggests the movement did not succeed.

Step 15: ✓ PASS
Input: look at the walls
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 16: ✗ FAIL
Input: go south
Reason: The response does not reflect the player's movement south as expected; it incorrectly returns to the Dungeon Entrance without acknowledging the previous room.

Step 17: ✗ FAIL
Input: go east
Reason: The response does not provide a new room description for a valid movement attempt, and instead incorrectly states that the player can't go that way.

Step 18: ✗ FAIL
Input: go north
Reason: The response does not indicate a successful movement into a new room, but rather repeats the description of the current room.

Step 19: ✓ PASS
Input: look around
Reason: Step completed successfully

Step 20: ✗ FAIL
Input: go south
Reason: The response incorrectly allowed movement south from the Dark Corridor to the Dungeon Entrance, which should not be possible as the player is in a dead-end corridor.
