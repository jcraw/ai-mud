        Dungeon Entrance
You step beneath a crumbling stone archway, the rough edges worn smooth by time and the whispers of countless footsteps. Moss clings stubbornly to the damp walls, its vibrant green a stark contrast to the dull grays and browns of the stone. Flickering torchlight dances against the ancient runes carved into the doorframe, their meanings now lost to the ages, while the musty air wraps around you like a forgotten memory waiting to be unearthed. The atmosphere is thick with anticipation, as if the very walls are holding their breath, waiting for you to make your next move.

You enter the Abandoned Throne Room, where a massive stone throne looms like a silent sentinel, its once-majestic form now draped in the dust of neglect. Faded royal tapestries hang limply from the walls, their colors muted to mere echoes of the splendor that once was, fluttering slightly in the chill draft that weaves through unseen passages. The cracked marble floor stretches beneath you, its surface marred by time and tales untold, while ominous shadows dance in the corners, hinting at the ghosts of a forgotten court. In the center of it all, a skeleton slumps upon the throne, a skeletal reminder of power long faded, as the air thickens with a palpable sense of loss and lingering despair.
