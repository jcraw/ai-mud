        Forgotten Armory
You step into the Forgotten Armory, where rusty weapon racks lean precariously against the walls, relics of a time when valor rang through these halls. Tarnished armor stands loom like ghostly sentinels, their once-polished surfaces now dulled by neglect. The air is thick with the pungent scent of old leather and metal, mingling with the musty aroma of dust. Cobwebs drape over the shields like shrouds, while ancient battle standards hang limply from the ceiling, whispering tales of glory long past.

        Forgotten Armory
You find yourself enveloped in the Forgotten Armory, where rusty weapon racks sag under the weight of time, their iron bones creaking softly. The tarnished armor stands rise like forgotten guardians, their surfaces etched with the memories of battles fought and lost. A heavy scent of old leather and corroded metal fills the air, entwined with the musty breath of disuse. Shadows gather in the corners, where cobwebs cling to shields, their delicate threads weaving a tapestry of neglect, while ancient battle standards dangle overhead, their colors faded yet still echoing the valiant cries of yesteryear.

You step deeper into the Forgotten Armory, the air thick with the ghosts of past glories and defeats. Rusty weapon racks lean heavily against crumbling walls, their once formidable blades now dulled and forgotten. Tarnished armor stands loom like silent witnesses, their surfaces mottled with age, while the musty scent of old leather and corroded metal envelops you in a suffocating embrace. Cobwebs drape over shields like spectral veils, and above, ancient battle standards sway gently, their faded colors a haunting reminder of heroic tales that echo faintly through the shadows.
