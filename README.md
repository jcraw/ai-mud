# AI-Powered MUD Engine

A text-based Multi-User Dungeon (MUD) game with dynamic LLM-generated content.

## Current Status

**âœ¨ Enhanced MVP with LLM Integration** - The game is fully playable with AI-powered descriptions! Currently features:

- **LLM-Powered Room Descriptions** - GPT-4o-mini generates vivid, atmospheric narratives
- Complete multi-module architecture with 6 modules
- Sample dungeon with 6 interconnected rooms, items, and NPCs
- Working console interface with text parser
- Movement, exploration, and inventory systems
- Graceful fallback when API key is not set

## Quick Start

### 1. Set up OpenAI API Key

Add your API key to `local.properties`:
```properties
openai.api.key=sk-your-key-here
```

Or set as environment variable:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-your-key-here"
```

### 2. Build and Run

```bash
gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app
```

### 3. Play!

Available commands:
- `n`, `s`, `e`, `w` - Move in cardinal directions
- `look` - Examine your surroundings
- `look <target>` - Examine a specific entity
- `inventory` - View your items
- `help` - Show command list
- `quit` - Exit game

## Features

### âœ… Implemented
- **LLM-Powered Descriptions**: Vivid room narratives generated by GPT-4o-mini
- **Sample Dungeon**: 6 interconnected rooms (entrance, corridor, treasury, armory, throne room, secret chamber)
- **Movement System**: Navigate between rooms with directional commands
- **Entity System**: Items (gold pouch, iron sword) and NPCs (skeleton king)
- **Trait-Based Generation**: Rooms defined by traits, descriptions created dynamically
- **Graceful Fallback**: Works without API key (simple trait concatenation)

### ðŸ”„ Coming Next
- Item pickup/drop mechanics
- NPC interaction system
- Combat mechanics
- Memory/RAG integration for persistent world history
- Advanced LLM-powered content generation

## Architecture

Multi-module Gradle project following clean architecture:

```
core       â†’ World model (Room, Entity, WorldState, PlayerState)
perception â†’ Input parsing (text â†’ Intent objects)
reasoning  â†’ LLM-powered generation and game logic
action     â†’ Output formatting and narration
memory     â†’ State persistence and vector database
llm        â†’ OpenAI client and LLM interfaces
app        â†’ Console-based game interface
```

## Development

### Build
```bash
gradle build
```

### Run Tests
```bash
gradle test
```

### Run Specific Module Tests
```bash
gradle :reasoning:test
gradle :perception:test
```

## Project Guidelines

- **KISS principle**: Avoid overengineering
- **Sealed classes** over enums
- **Behavior-driven testing**: Test contracts, not coverage
- **File size**: Keep modules under 300-500 lines
- **Cost optimization**: Use gpt-4o-mini for development
