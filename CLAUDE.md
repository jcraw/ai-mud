# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Current State: FEATURE-COMPLETE MVP** - This is an AI-powered MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) engine with modular architecture, core data models, sample dungeon, and a working console-based game loop with turn-based combat, equipment system, and consumables. The vision is to create a text-based roleplaying game with dynamic LLM-generated content.

### What Exists Now
- Complete Gradle multi-module setup with 6 modules
- Core world model: Room, WorldState, PlayerState, Entity hierarchy, CombatState, ItemType
- Direction enum with bidirectional mapping
- **Sample dungeon with 6 interconnected rooms, entities, and rich trait lists**
- **Intent sealed class hierarchy (Move, Look, Interact, Take, Drop, Talk, Attack, Equip, Use, Inventory, Help, Quit)**
- **Working console game loop with text parser**
- **OpenAI LLM client fully integrated with ktor 3.1.0**
- **RoomDescriptionGenerator - LLM-powered vivid room descriptions** ‚ú®
- **NPCInteractionGenerator - LLM-powered dynamic NPC dialogue** ‚ú®
- **CombatNarrator - LLM-powered atmospheric combat descriptions** ‚ú®
- **API key support via local.properties or OPENAI_API_KEY env var**
- **GAME IS FULLY PLAYABLE** - movement, looking, combat, items, LLM descriptions work
- **Item mechanics** - pickup/drop items with take/get/drop/put commands ‚úÖ
- **NPC interaction** - talk to NPCs with personality-driven dialogue ‚úÖ
- **Combat system** - turn-based combat with attack/defend/flee, LLM-narrated ‚úÖ
- **Equipment system** - equip weapons for damage bonuses ‚úÖ
- **Consumables** - use potions/items for healing ‚úÖ

### What Needs to Be Built Next
Remaining tasks organized by priority:
1. **Skill checks** - Stat-based interactions and combat modifiers
2. **Armor system** - Equip armor for defense bonuses
3. Later: Memory/RAG, procedural generation, multi-user support

## Commands

### Build and Development
- `gradle build` - Build the project (requires Java 17 toolchain)
- `gradle check` - Run all checks including tests
- `gradle clean` - Clean all build outputs
- `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app` - **Run the game!**
- `gradle :app:build` - Build just the app module

### Testing
- `gradle test` - Run unit tests across all modules
- `gradle :core:test` - Run tests for core module
- `gradle :perception:test` - Run tests for perception module
- `gradle :reasoning:test` - Run tests for reasoning module
- `gradle :memory:test` - Run tests for memory module
- `gradle :action:test` - Run tests for action module
- `gradle :app:test` - Run tests for app module

## Project Structure

Multi-module Gradle project:

### Current Modules
- **core** - World model (Room, WorldState, PlayerState, Entity, Direction)
- **perception** - Input parsing and intent recognition (depends on: core, llm)
- **reasoning** - LLM-powered content generation and game logic (depends on: core, llm, memory)
- **memory** - Vector database integration and state persistence (depends on: core)
- **action** - Output formatting and narration (depends on: core)
- **llm** - OpenAI client and LLM interfaces
- **app** - Main game application and console interface
- **utils** - Shared utilities

### Build Configuration
- Uses Gradle with Kotlin DSL
- Version catalog in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- Convention plugin in `buildSrc` for shared build logic
- Java 17 toolchain, Kotlin 2.2.0
- kotlinx ecosystem dependencies configured

## Implementation Notes

### Implemented Architecture
Clean separation following the planned architecture:
- **Core** - Immutable data models and world state
- **Perception** - Input parsing and LLM-based intent recognition
- **Reasoning** - LLM-powered generation and game logic resolution
- **Action** - Output narration and response generation
- **Memory** - Vector database for history and structured world state

### Data Flow
1. User input ‚Üí **Perception** (parse to Intent)
2. Intent + WorldState ‚Üí **Reasoning** (generate response + new state)
3. Response ‚Üí **Action** (format output)
4. All interactions ‚Üí **Memory** (store for RAG)

### Key Principles
- KISS principle - avoid overengineering
- Use sealed classes over enums
- Focus on behavior-driven testing
- Files under 300-500 lines
- Use GPT4_1Nano for cost savings during development

## Getting Started (Next Developer)

1. **Set up API key**: Add `openai.api.key=sk-...` to `local.properties` (or set OPENAI_API_KEY env var)
2. **Run the game**: `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app` or `./test_combat.sh`
3. **Commands available**:
   - Movement: `n/s/e/w`, `north/south/east/west`, `go <direction>`
   - Interaction: `look [target]`, `take/get <item>`, `drop/put <item>`, `talk/speak <npc>`, `inventory/i`
   - Combat: `attack/kill/fight/hit <npc>` to start combat, then `attack` to continue
   - Equipment: `equip/wield <weapon>` to equip weapons for damage bonuses
   - Consumables: `use/consume/drink/eat <item>` to use healing potions
   - Meta: `help`, `quit`
4. **Sample dungeon**: 6 rooms with items (gold pouch, iron sword +5, steel dagger +3, health potion +30HP) and NPCs (Old Guard, Skeleton King)
5. **LLM features**:
   - Room descriptions dynamically generated using gpt-4o-mini
   - NPC dialogue personality-driven (friendly vs hostile, health-aware)
   - Combat narratives with visceral, atmospheric descriptions
6. **Item mechanics**: Pick up items, drop them, equip weapons, use consumables
7. **NPC interaction**: Talk to NPCs and get contextual, personality-driven responses
8. **Combat system**: Turn-based combat with health tracking, weapon damage bonuses, victory/defeat conditions
9. **Equipment system**: Equip weapons to increase damage, use healing potions during or outside combat
10. **Next logical step**: Implement skill checks for stat-based interactions

The feature-complete MVP has LLM-powered descriptions, full item system (pickup/drop/equip/use), NPC dialogue, AND turn-based combat with equipment - focus on skill checks next.
