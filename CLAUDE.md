# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Current State: GUI CLIENT WITH REAL ENGINE INTEGRATION COMPLETE** - This is an AI-powered MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) engine with modular architecture, procedural dungeon generation, **dynamic quest system**, persistent save/load system, fully functional multi-user game server, **fully integrated Compose Multiplatform GUI client**, and working console-based game loop with turn-based combat, full equipment system (weapons & armor), consumables, D&D-style skill checks, and RAG-enhanced memory system for contextual narratives.

**Quick Start**:
- Console: `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app`
- GUI Client: `gradle :client:run`

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Input
    ↓
Perception (text → Intent)
    ↓
Reasoning (Intent + WorldState → Response + NewState)
    ↓
Action (format output)
    ↓
Memory (store for RAG)
```

### Key Principles
- **KISS principle** - Avoid overengineering
- **Sealed classes over enums** - Better type safety
- **Immutable state** - All state transitions return new copies
- **Thread-safe mutations** - Kotlin coroutines with Mutex
- **Behavior-driven testing** - Focus on contracts
- **Files under 300-500 lines** - Maintain readability

## Getting Started

1. **Set up API key**: Add `openai.api.key=sk-...` to `local.properties` (or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var)
   - Game works without API key in fallback mode with simpler descriptions
2. **Run the game**: `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app`
3. **Choose game mode**: Single-player or multi-user (local) at startup
4. **Choose dungeon**: Sample (6 rooms) or procedural (4 themes, customizable size)
5. **Play**: See [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for full command reference

### Available Commands
- **Movement**: `n/s/e/w`, `north/south/east/west`, `go <direction>`
- **Interaction**: `look [target]`, `take/get <item>`, `drop <item>`, `talk <npc>`, `inventory/i`
- **Combat**: `attack/kill/fight/hit <npc>` to start/continue combat
- **Equipment**: `equip/wield/wear <item>` to equip weapons or armor
- **Consumables**: `use/consume/drink/eat <item>` to use healing potions
- **Skill checks**: `check/test <feature>` to attempt skill checks
- **Social**: `persuade/convince <npc>` and `intimidate/threaten <npc>` for CHA checks
- **Quests**: `quests/journal/j` to view quests, `accept <id>`, `abandon <id>`, `claim <id>`
- **Persistence**: `save [name]` to save, `load [name]` to load
- **Meta**: `help`, `quit`

## Quest System

The dynamic quest system generates procedural quests based on dungeon state and theme.

### Quest Objective Types (6)
1. **Kill** - Defeat a specific NPC
2. **Collect** - Gather items (with quantity tracking)
3. **Explore** - Visit a specific room
4. **Talk** - Converse with an NPC
5. **UseSkill** - Successfully complete a skill check
6. **Deliver** - Bring an item to an NPC

### Quest Lifecycle
- **ACTIVE** - Quest accepted and in progress
- **COMPLETED** - All objectives finished, reward ready
- **CLAIMED** - Reward collected
- **FAILED** - Quest abandoned (not yet implemented)

### Quest Commands
- `quests` or `journal` or `j` - View quest log with active/available/completed quests
- `accept <quest_id>` - Accept an available quest
- `abandon <quest_id>` - Remove an active quest
- `claim <quest_id>` - Claim rewards for completed quest (XP, gold, items)

### Quest Rewards
- **Experience points** - Track player progression
- **Gold** - In-game currency
- **Items** - Weapons, armor, consumables

## Multi-User Architecture

The game supports multiple concurrent players in a shared world:
- **GameServer**: Thread-safe shared WorldState with Mutex protection
- **PlayerSession**: Per-player I/O and event channels
- **Event broadcasting**: Players see actions happening in their room
- **Per-player combat**: Each player has independent combat state
- **Mode selection**: Choose single-player or multi-user at startup

See [Multi-User Documentation](docs/MULTI_USER.md) for complete details.

## Important Notes

- **No backward compatibility needed** - Can wipe and restart data between versions
- **API key optional** - Game works without OpenAI API key (fallback mode)
- **Java 17 required** - Uses Java 17 toolchain
- **All modules building** - 60+ tests passing
- **Project guidelines**: See `CLAUDE_GUIDELINES.md`
- **Requirements**: See `docs/requirements.txt`

## Current Status: Exploration Test Optimization Complete (2025-10-11)

**What Changed**: Optimized the exploration test scenario for better coverage and efficiency.

**Issues Identified**:
1. **Insufficient room coverage** - Test only visited 2/6 rooms (33%) despite 20 steps
2. **Redundant commands** - 30% of steps were repetitive (4x looking at gold coins, 3x looking around same room)
3. **Inefficient pathing** - Bot kept going back and forth between Treasury and Corridor without exploring other areas
4. **No exploration metrics** - No tracking of unique rooms visited

**Improvements Applied**:
1. **Reduced step count from 20 → 15** (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/TestScenario.kt:19`)
   - Removed redundancy while maintaining coverage
2. **Enhanced input generation** (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/InputGenerator.kt:78-104`)
   - Added breadth-first exploration guidance
   - Track rooms visited and display to LLM
   - Prioritize NEW rooms over revisiting
   - Discourage repeated object examination
3. **Room tracking system** (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/InputGenerator.kt:199-216`)
   - Extract room names from GM responses with regex
   - Pass full history to generator for accurate tracking
4. **Exploration metrics** (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/TestModels.kt:111-159`)
   - Added `uniqueRoomsVisited` and `roomNames` to TestReport
   - Display "X / 5 rooms visited" in console and summary logs
   - Track which specific rooms were explored

**Expected Results**:
- **Better coverage**: Should reach 4-5 rooms in 15 steps (up from 2 rooms in 20 steps)
- **Less redundancy**: Avoid looking at same object multiple times
- **Clearer metrics**: See exactly which rooms were explored
- **More efficient**: 25% fewer steps with better results

**Status**: ✅ All changes implemented and built. Ready for testing with `gradle :testbot:run --args="exploration"`

## Next Developer

The GUI client with real engine integration, quest system, and automated testing are complete! Next priorities:
1. **🧪 TEST EXPLORATION IMPROVEMENTS** - Run `gradle :testbot:run --args="exploration"` to verify 4-5 room coverage
2. **Quest auto-tracking** - Automatically update quest progress as player performs actions (kill NPCs, collect items, explore rooms, etc.)
3. **Fix unit test failures** - 5 testbot tests failing due to JSON serialization changes (line count assertions need updating)
4. **Network layer** (optional) - TCP/WebSocket support for remote multi-player
5. **Persistent vector storage** (optional) - Save/load embeddings to disk

See [Implementation Log](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md) for full feature history.
