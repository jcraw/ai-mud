# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Current State: GUI CLIENT WITH REAL ENGINE INTEGRATION COMPLETE** - This is an AI-powered MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) engine with modular architecture, procedural dungeon generation, **dynamic quest system**, persistent save/load system, fully functional multi-user game server, **fully integrated Compose Multiplatform GUI client**, and working console-based game loop with turn-based combat, full equipment system (weapons & armor), consumables, D&D-style skill checks, and RAG-enhanced memory system for contextual narratives.

**Quick Start**:
- Console: `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app`
- GUI Client: `gradle :client:run`

## Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Input
    ↓
Perception (text → Intent)
    ↓
Reasoning (Intent + WorldState → Response + NewState)
    ↓
Action (format output)
    ↓
Memory (store for RAG)
```

### Key Principles
- **KISS principle** - Avoid overengineering
- **Sealed classes over enums** - Better type safety
- **Immutable state** - All state transitions return new copies
- **Thread-safe mutations** - Kotlin coroutines with Mutex
- **Behavior-driven testing** - Focus on contracts
- **Files under 300-500 lines** - Maintain readability

## Getting Started

1. **Set up API key**: Add `openai.api.key=sk-...` to `local.properties` (or set `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var)
   - Game works without API key in fallback mode with simpler descriptions
2. **Run the game**: `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app`
3. **Choose game mode**: Single-player or multi-user (local) at startup
4. **Choose dungeon**: Sample (6 rooms) or procedural (4 themes, customizable size)
5. **Play**: See [Getting Started Guide](docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) for full command reference

### Available Commands
- **Movement**: `n/s/e/w`, `north/south/east/west`, `go <direction>`
- **Interaction**: `look [target]`, `take/get <item>`, `drop <item>`, `talk <npc>`, `inventory/i`
- **Combat**: `attack/kill/fight/hit <npc>` to start/continue combat
- **Equipment**: `equip/wield/wear <item>` to equip weapons or armor
- **Consumables**: `use/consume/drink/eat <item>` to use healing potions
- **Skill checks**: `check/test <feature>` to attempt skill checks
- **Social**: `persuade/convince <npc>` and `intimidate/threaten <npc>` for CHA checks
- **Quests**: `quests/journal/j` to view quests, `accept <id>`, `abandon <id>`, `claim <id>`
- **Persistence**: `save [name]` to save, `load [name]` to load
- **Meta**: `help`, `quit`

## Quest System

The dynamic quest system generates procedural quests based on dungeon state and theme.

### Quest Objective Types (6)
1. **Kill** - Defeat a specific NPC
2. **Collect** - Gather items (with quantity tracking)
3. **Explore** - Visit a specific room
4. **Talk** - Converse with an NPC
5. **UseSkill** - Successfully complete a skill check
6. **Deliver** - Bring an item to an NPC

### Quest Lifecycle
- **ACTIVE** - Quest accepted and in progress
- **COMPLETED** - All objectives finished, reward ready
- **CLAIMED** - Reward collected
- **FAILED** - Quest abandoned (not yet implemented)

### Quest Commands
- `quests` or `journal` or `j` - View quest log with active/available/completed quests
- `accept <quest_id>` - Accept an available quest
- `abandon <quest_id>` - Remove an active quest
- `claim <quest_id>` - Claim rewards for completed quest (XP, gold, items)

### Quest Rewards
- **Experience points** - Track player progression
- **Gold** - In-game currency
- **Items** - Weapons, armor, consumables

## Multi-User Architecture

The game supports multiple concurrent players in a shared world:
- **GameServer**: Thread-safe shared WorldState with Mutex protection
- **PlayerSession**: Per-player I/O and event channels
- **Event broadcasting**: Players see actions happening in their room
- **Per-player combat**: Each player has independent combat state
- **Mode selection**: Choose single-player or multi-user at startup

See [Multi-User Documentation](docs/MULTI_USER.md) for complete details.

## Important Notes

- **No backward compatibility needed** - Can wipe and restart data between versions
- **API key optional** - Game works without OpenAI API key (fallback mode)
- **Java 17 required** - Uses Java 17 toolchain
- **All modules building** - 60+ tests passing
- **Project guidelines**: See `CLAUDE_GUIDELINES.md`
- **Requirements**: See `docs/requirements.txt`

## Current Status: Test Bot Validation Fixes - Round 3 (2025-10-11)

**Issue**: Exploration test scenario validation logic was incorrectly failing valid game responses (initial 70% → improved to 85% pass rate, but still 3/20 false failures).

**Root Causes Identified** (from analyzing test logs):
1. **LLM validator confusion about room entry** - Validator saw "Ancient Treasury" description and thought player "remained in same room" or "entered again", when actually it was the FIRST entry
2. **Invalid direction rejection misunderstood** - Validator failed "You can't go that way" responses even when the direction was correctly invalid (e.g., "go south" when only "west" exit exists)
3. **Validation rules not explicit enough** - Even with examples, LLM was still misinterpreting successful movements

**Fixes Applied** (in `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt:147-197`):
1. **Round 1-2 fixes**:
   - Enhanced room tracking (extract current + previous room names)
   - "ROOM CHANGED: X → Y" markers in validation context
   - Basic movement validation rules with examples
2. **Round 3 fixes** (LATEST):
   - **Ultra-explicit validation rules** with RULE 1-4 format in ALL CAPS
   - **Real examples from actual failed validations** that should pass
   - **Negative examples** showing what should fail (crashes, invalid exits that exist)
   - **Triple emphasis** on "DO NOT FAIL" scenarios (room revisits, correct rejections, room descriptions after movement)

**Failed Test Analysis** (from `test-logs/exploration_1760225557539_summary.txt`):
- **Step 7 & 16**: Player "go east" from Dark Corridor → "Ancient Treasury" description → Validator INCORRECTLY failed (said "entered again" or "remained in same room")
  - **Reality**: This was SUCCESSFUL movement east to Treasury
  - **Fix**: Added explicit example matching this exact scenario to validation rules
- **Step 20**: Player "go south" from Ancient Treasury (only exit: west) → "You can't go that way" → Validator INCORRECTLY failed (said "should allow movement... exit to west exists")
  - **Reality**: South is INVALID, west is irrelevant, rejection was CORRECT
  - **Fix**: Emphasized checking game state exits BEFORE failing on rejections

**Status**: ✅ Round 3 fixes implemented and built. **Awaiting test run** to verify if LLM validator now understands the rules.

**Next Steps**:
1. **Run exploration test**: User will execute `gradle :testbot:run --args="exploration"`
2. **Check pass rate**: Target is 95%+ (19-20/20 passing)
3. **If still failing**: May need to switch validation strategy (rule-based instead of LLM-based, or use few-shot examples directly in prompt)
4. **Apply to other scenarios**: Once exploration validation is solid, apply same approach to combat, skill checks, etc.

## Next Developer

The GUI client with real engine integration, quest system, and automated testing are complete! Next priorities:
1. **🔧 VERIFY ROUND 3 VALIDATION FIXES** - Check if exploration test pass rate improved from 85% → 95%+
2. **Consider alternative validation approach** - If LLM validator still struggles, implement rule-based validation for movement (check for room name in response = success)
3. **Fix remaining test bot validation issues** - Apply lessons learned to other test scenarios (combat, skill checks, etc.)
4. **Quest auto-tracking** - Automatically update quest progress as player performs actions (kill NPCs, collect items, explore rooms, etc.)
5. **Network layer** (optional) - TCP/WebSocket support for remote multi-player
6. **Persistent vector storage** (optional) - Save/load embeddings to disk
