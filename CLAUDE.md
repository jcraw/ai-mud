## Implementation Notes

### Implemented Architecture
Clean separation following the planned architecture:
- **Core** - Immutable data models and world state
- **Perception** - Input parsing and LLM-based intent recognition
- **Reasoning** - LLM-powered generation and game logic resolution
- **Action** - Output narration and response generation
- **Memory** - Vector database for history and structured world state

### Data Flow
1. User input ‚Üí **Perception** (parse to Intent)
2. Intent + WorldState ‚Üí **Reasoning** (generate response + new state)
3. Response ‚Üí **Action** (format output)
4. All interactions ‚Üí **Memory** (store for RAG)

### Key Principles
- KISS principle - avoid overengineering
- Use sealed classes over enums
- Focus on behavior-driven testing
- Files under 300-500 lines
- Use GPT4_1Nano for cost savings during development

## Getting Started (Next Developer)

1. **Set up API key**: Add `openai.api.key=sk-...` to `local.properties` (or set OPENAI_API_KEY env var)
2. **Run the game**: `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app`
3. **Choose game mode**: At startup, select from:
   - **Single-player mode** - Traditional single-player experience with save/load support
   - **Multi-user mode (local)** - Uses GameServer architecture (future network support)
4. **Choose dungeon type**: At startup, select from:
   - Sample Dungeon (handcrafted, 6 rooms)
   - Procedural Crypt (ancient tombs)
   - Procedural Castle (ruined fortress)
   - Procedural Cave (dark caverns)
   - Procedural Temple (forgotten shrine)
   - Specify room count for procedural dungeons (default: 10)
5. **Commands available**:
   - Movement: `n/s/e/w`, `north/south/east/west`, `go <direction>`
   - Interaction: `look [target]`, `take/get <item>`, `drop/put <item>`, `talk/speak <npc>`, `inventory/i`
   - Combat: `attack/kill/fight/hit <npc>` to start combat, then `attack` to continue
   - Equipment: `equip/wield/wear <item>` to equip weapons or armor
   - Consumables: `use/consume/drink/eat <item>` to use healing potions
   - Skill Checks: `check/test <feature>` to attempt skill checks on interactive features
   - Social: `persuade/convince <npc>` and `intimidate/threaten <npc>` for CHA checks
   - Persistence: `save [name]` to save game (defaults to 'quicksave'), `load [name]` to load game
   - Meta: `help`, `quit`
6. **Dungeon types**:
   - **Sample dungeon**: 6 handcrafted rooms with items (weapons, armor, potions, gold) and NPCs (Old Guard, Skeleton King)
   - **Procedural dungeons**: Dynamically generated with theme-appropriate traits, random NPCs, and distributed loot
7. **LLM features**:
   - Room descriptions dynamically generated using gpt-4o-mini with RAG context
   - NPC dialogue personality-driven (friendly vs hostile, health-aware) with conversation history
   - Combat narratives with visceral, atmospheric descriptions that build on previous rounds
   - Embeddings via text-embedding-3-small for semantic memory retrieval
8. **Item mechanics**: Pick up items, drop them, equip weapons, use consumables
9. **NPC interaction**: Talk to NPCs and get contextual, personality-driven responses that reference past conversations
10. **Combat system**: Turn-based combat with health tracking, weapon damage bonuses, victory/defeat conditions
11. **Equipment system**: Equip weapons to increase damage, equip armor to reduce damage taken
12. **Skill system**: D&D-style stats (STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA) with d20 + modifier vs DC
13. **Combat modifiers**: STR affects damage dealt, armor defense reduces damage taken
14. **Armor mechanics**: Chainmail (+4 defense) reduces incoming damage by 4, leather armor (+2) reduces by 2
15. **Skill check challenges**: 4 interactive features in sample dungeon - loose stone (WIS/DC10), locked chest (DEX/DC15), stuck door (STR/DC20), runes (INT/DC15)
16. **Social interactions**: Persuade Old Guard (CHA/DC10) for hints, intimidate Skeleton King (CHA/DC20) to avoid combat
17. **RAG Memory**: All game events stored with embeddings, retrieved contextually for LLM prompts
18. **Procedural generation**: Create dungeons of any size with 4 themes, each with unique traits, NPCs with varied stats, and distributed loot
19. **Persistence**: Save and load game state to/from JSON files - preserves player stats, inventory, equipment, combat state, and world state
20. **Multi-user architecture**: Complete integration - GameServer wired into App.kt with mode selection
21. **Multi-user mode**: Choose at startup for server-based gameplay (ready for network layer)
22. **Next logical step**: Add dynamic quest generation or network layer for remote multi-player

## Multi-User Architecture Details

The foundation for multi-user support is complete. Here's what was built:

### Architecture Changes (Completed)
- **PlayerId type**: `typealias PlayerId = String` for player identification
- **WorldState refactored**: Changed from `player: PlayerState` to `players: Map<PlayerId, PlayerState>`
- **Per-player combat**: `activeCombat` moved from WorldState to PlayerState (each player has independent combat)
- **Multi-player API**:
  - `getCurrentRoom(playerId)` - Get room for specific player
  - `getPlayer(playerId)` - Retrieve player state
  - `addPlayer(playerState)` - Add new player to world
  - `removePlayer(playerId)` - Remove player from world
  - `getPlayersInRoom(roomId)` - Query all players in a room
  - `movePlayer(playerId, direction)` - Move specific player
- **Backward compatibility**: `worldState.player` property still works (returns first player)
- **CombatResolver updated**: Now accepts player parameter for per-player combat resolution

### Multi-User Server Implementation (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
1. ‚úÖ **Entity.Player** - New entity type to represent other players in rooms (for visibility)
2. ‚úÖ **GameServer** - Manages shared WorldState and coordinates multiple player sessions with thread-safe mutations
3. ‚úÖ **PlayerSession** - Handles individual player I/O and maintains player context with event channels
4. ‚úÖ **GameEvent sealed class** - Event types for player actions (join, leave, move, say, combat, generic)
5. ‚úÖ **Broadcast system** - Notify players of actions happening in their current room via event channels
6. ‚úÖ **All intents supported** - Move, Look, Attack, Talk, Take, Drop, Equip, Use, Check, Persuade, Intimidate, Inventory
7. ‚úÖ **Thread safety** - Kotlin coroutines with Mutex for safe concurrent access to WorldState

### Multi-User Server Integration (‚úÖ COMPLETE)
1. ‚úÖ **MultiUserGame class** - Manages GameServer lifecycle and player sessions
2. ‚úÖ **Mode selection** - Choose between single-player and multi-user modes at startup
3. ‚úÖ **GameServer integration** - Wired into App.kt main() function
4. ‚úÖ **Fallback support** - Mock LLM clients for multi-user mode without API key
5. ‚úÖ **Complete game logic** - All intents work in multi-user context
6. ‚úÖ **Thread-safe** - Mutex-protected WorldState mutations for concurrent access

### Remaining Work for Network Multi-User
1. **Network layer** (optional) - TCP/WebSocket server for remote connections
2. **Client protocol** - Message format for network communication
3. **Add multi-user tests** - JUnit dependencies and integration tests for app module

The feature-complete MVP has LLM-powered descriptions with RAG memory, full item system (pickup/drop/equip/use), NPC dialogue with conversation history, turn-based combat with weapons AND armor, stat-based skill checks (all 6 stats used!), interactive skill challenges, social interaction system with persuasion and intimidation, semantic memory retrieval for contextual narratives, procedural dungeon generation with 4 themes, persistent save/load system, multi-user capable architecture, fully-integrated GameServer with event broadcasting, AND mode selection for single-player vs multi-user gameplay!
