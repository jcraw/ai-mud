# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Current State: PLAYABLE MVP** - This is an AI-powered MUD (Multi-User Dungeon) engine with modular architecture, core data models, sample dungeon, and a working console-based game loop. The vision is to create a text-based roleplaying game with dynamic LLM-generated content.

### What Exists Now
- Complete Gradle multi-module setup with 6 modules
- Core world model: Room, WorldState, PlayerState, Entity hierarchy
- Direction enum with bidirectional mapping
- **Sample dungeon with 6 interconnected rooms, entities, and rich trait lists**
- **Intent sealed class hierarchy (Move, Look, Interact, Inventory, Help, Quit)**
- **Working console game loop with text parser**
- **OpenAI LLM client fully integrated with ktor 3.1.0**
- **GAME IS PLAYABLE** - movement, looking, basic commands work

### What Needs to Be Built Next
Remaining tasks organized by priority:
1. **LLM-powered descriptions** - Generate room descriptions from traits using OpenAI
2. **Item mechanics** - Pickup/drop items, manage inventory
3. **Interaction system** - Use items, talk to NPCs, trigger events
4. Later: Combat, skill checks, memory/RAG, advanced generation

## Commands

### Build and Development
- `gradle build` - Build the project (requires Java 17 toolchain)
- `gradle check` - Run all checks including tests
- `gradle clean` - Clean all build outputs
- `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app` - **Run the game!**
- `gradle :app:build` - Build just the app module

### Testing
- `gradle test` - Run unit tests across all modules
- `gradle :core:test` - Run tests for core module
- `gradle :perception:test` - Run tests for perception module
- `gradle :reasoning:test` - Run tests for reasoning module
- `gradle :memory:test` - Run tests for memory module
- `gradle :action:test` - Run tests for action module
- `gradle :app:test` - Run tests for app module

## Project Structure

Multi-module Gradle project:

### Current Modules
- **core** - World model (Room, WorldState, PlayerState, Entity, Direction)
- **perception** - Input parsing and intent recognition (depends on: core, llm)
- **reasoning** - LLM-powered content generation and game logic (depends on: core, llm, memory)
- **memory** - Vector database integration and state persistence (depends on: core)
- **action** - Output formatting and narration (depends on: core)
- **llm** - OpenAI client and LLM interfaces
- **app** - Main game application and console interface
- **utils** - Shared utilities

### Build Configuration
- Uses Gradle with Kotlin DSL
- Version catalog in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`
- Convention plugin in `buildSrc` for shared build logic
- Java 17 toolchain, Kotlin 2.2.0
- kotlinx ecosystem dependencies configured

## Implementation Notes

### Implemented Architecture
Clean separation following the planned architecture:
- **Core** - Immutable data models and world state
- **Perception** - Input parsing and LLM-based intent recognition
- **Reasoning** - LLM-powered generation and game logic resolution
- **Action** - Output narration and response generation
- **Memory** - Vector database for history and structured world state

### Data Flow
1. User input â†’ **Perception** (parse to Intent)
2. Intent + WorldState â†’ **Reasoning** (generate response + new state)
3. Response â†’ **Action** (format output)
4. All interactions â†’ **Memory** (store for RAG)

### Key Principles
- KISS principle - avoid overengineering
- Use sealed classes over enums
- Focus on behavior-driven testing
- Files under 300-500 lines
- Use GPT4_1Nano for cost savings during development

## Implementation Status

### Completed
âœ… Module structure and dependencies
âœ… Core data models (Room, WorldState, PlayerState, Entity, Direction)
âœ… Sample dungeon with 6 interconnected rooms, entities, and rich traits
âœ… Immutable state design with helper methods
âœ… Java 17 toolchain configuration
âœ… Intent sealed class hierarchy with comprehensive tests
âœ… LLM module with ktor 3.1.0 dependencies - builds successfully
âœ… **Console-based game loop - PLAYABLE MVP**
âœ… **Text parser converting input to Intent objects**
âœ… **Movement, look, inventory, help commands functional**

### Current Status: Playable MVP Complete
âœ… All modules building successfully
âœ… Game runs and responds to player commands
âœ… Sample dungeon fully navigable

### Next Priority
ðŸ”„ LLM-powered room description generation
ðŸ”„ Item pickup/drop mechanics
ðŸ”„ NPC interaction system

## Important Notes

- **Main application**: `com.jcraw.app.AppKt` - fully implemented and working
- All modules integrated into build system and building successfully
- No backward compatibility needed - can wipe and restart data
- Project follows guidelines in `CLAUDE_GUIDELINES.md`
- Requirements are in `docs/requirements.txt`
- Sample dungeon: `core/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/core/SampleDungeon.kt`
- Game loop: `app/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/app/App.kt`
- Intent system: `perception/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/perception/Intent.kt`

## Getting Started (Next Developer)

1. **Try the game**: `gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app`
2. **Commands work**: `n` (north), `look`, `help`, `inventory`, `quit`
3. **Sample dungeon**: 6 rooms with items (gold pouch, iron sword) and NPCs (skeleton king)
4. **Next logical step**: Integrate LLM for dynamic room descriptions instead of static trait lists
5. **Architecture ready**: Perceptionâ†’Reasoningâ†’Action flow, just needs LLM hookup

The MVP is complete and playable - focus on LLM integration for richer descriptions next.
