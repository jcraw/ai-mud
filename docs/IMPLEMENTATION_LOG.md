## Test Bot Validation Fixes - Round 2 & 3 (2025-10-11) 🔧

**Issue**: Exploration test scenario had false failures due to LLM validator misinterpreting valid game responses.
- **Initial**: 70% pass rate (14/20, 6 false failures)
- **After Round 2**: 85% pass rate (17/20, 3 false failures)
- **Round 3 goal**: 95%+ pass rate (19-20/20)

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **LLM validator confusion about room entry** (Round 3) - Validator saw "Ancient Treasury" description after "go east" and thought player "remained in same room" or "entered again", when actually it was the FIRST successful entry
2. **Invalid direction rejection misunderstood** (Round 3) - Validator failed "You can't go that way" responses even when the direction was correctly invalid (e.g., "go south" when only "west" exit exists)
3. **No room transition tracking** (Round 2) - Validator couldn't see if player moved from "Room A" → "Room B"
4. **Missing explicit movement text** (Round 2) - Game shows new room directly, not "You move north"
5. **Validation rules not explicit enough** (Round 2 & 3) - LLM needed increasingly explicit instructions with real examples

**Changes Made** (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt`):

**Round 2 fixes** (lines 85-171):
1. Enhanced room tracking - Extract both current and previous room names from responses
2. Explicit transition detection - Show "ROOM CHANGED: X → Y" message in validation context
3. Strengthened validation rules - Added real examples from failed tests
4. Clear pass/fail criteria - Emphasized room description = successful movement

**Round 3 fixes** (lines 147-197):
1. **Ultra-explicit validation rules** - RULE 1-4 format in ALL CAPS with detailed explanations
2. **Real examples from actual failed validations** - Copied exact scenarios from step 7, 16, 20 failures
3. **Negative examples** - Show what SHOULD fail (crashes, rejections when exit exists)
4. **Triple emphasis on "DO NOT FAIL"** - Explicit warnings about room revisits, correct rejections, room descriptions after movement

**Failed Test Analysis** (from `test-logs/exploration_1760225557539_summary.txt`):
- **Step 7 & 16**: "go east" → "Ancient Treasury" description → Validator INCORRECTLY failed
  - Fixed: Added explicit example matching this scenario to validation rules
- **Step 20**: "go south" (invalid) → "You can't go that way" → Validator INCORRECTLY failed
  - Fixed: Emphasized checking game state exits BEFORE failing on rejections

**Technical Details**:
- Lines 93-107: Extract current and previous room names, filtering out "You..." responses
- Lines 121-133: Build room transition info showing explicit room changes
- Lines 147-197: Updated exploration scenario with RULE 1-4 format and real failure examples

**Status**: ✅ Round 3 fixes implemented and built. **Awaiting test run** to verify if LLM validator now understands.

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `gradle :testbot:run --args="exploration"` to check if pass rate improved to 95%+
2. If still failing: Consider switching to rule-based validation (regex for room names) instead of LLM-based
3. Apply same validation improvements to other test scenarios (combat, skill checks, etc.)
