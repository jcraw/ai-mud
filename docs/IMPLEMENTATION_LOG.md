# Implementation Log

This document tracks all completed features and implementations in chronological order.

## 2025-10-21: Skill System Phase 8 - Social System Integration

**Status**: Complete ✅

**Feature**: Skill-based social interactions replacing legacy D&D stat checks

**Implementation**:
- ✅ DispositionManager extended with SkillManager integration:
  - `attemptPersuasion()` - Uses Diplomacy skill (d20 + skill level vs DC)
  - `attemptIntimidation()` - Uses Charisma skill (d20 + skill level vs DC)
  - `trainSkillWithNPC()` - Train skills with friendly/allied NPCs
- ✅ XP rewards on social interactions:
  - 50 base XP for persuasion/intimidation attempts
  - Full XP on success, 20% XP on failure
  - Automatic skill progression through use
- ✅ NPC training system:
  - Friendly NPCs (disposition 50+) allow training
  - Allied NPCs give 2.5x XP multiplier
  - Friendly NPCs give 2.0x XP multiplier
  - Training unlocks skills at level 1 with buffs
- ✅ New SocialEvent types:
  - PersuasionAttempt - Variable disposition change based on skill margin
  - IntimidationAttempt - Variable disposition change based on skill margin
- ✅ Disposition-based rewards:
  - Success: +10 to +20 disposition (persuasion), +5 to +15 (intimidation)
  - Failure: -5 disposition (persuasion), -10 (intimidation)
- ✅ Integration tests: 15 comprehensive tests in SkillSocialIntegrationTest.kt

**Files Modified**:
1. `reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/DispositionManager.kt`
   - Added skillManager parameter (optional for backward compat)
   - Implemented attemptPersuasion(), attemptIntimidation(), trainSkillWithNPC()
   - Added canTrainPlayer(), getTrainingMultiplier() helpers
2. `reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/skill/SkillManager.kt`
   - Made skillRepo internal for DispositionManager access
3. `core/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/core/SocialEvent.kt`
   - Added PersuasionAttempt and IntimidationAttempt events
4. `memory/src/test/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/memory/social/SkillSocialIntegrationTest.kt` (NEW)
   - 15 integration tests covering all social-skill interactions

**Design Decisions**:
- Persuasion uses Diplomacy skill (explicitly listed as social/utility in SkillDefinitions)
- Intimidation uses Charisma skill (force of personality)
- Variable disposition changes based on skill check margin (better skills = better outcomes)
- Training requires friendly/allied disposition to access
- Disposition buffs motivate player to build positive relationships

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Persuasion uses Diplomacy skill
- ✅ Intimidation uses Charisma skill
- ✅ XP granted on success and failure
- ✅ Disposition changes based on outcome
- ✅ Training unlocks skills with friendly NPCs
- ✅ Training grants boosted XP (2.0x - 2.5x)
- ✅ Hostile/neutral NPCs refuse training
- ✅ Unknown skill training fails gracefully
- ✅ Backward compatibility without SkillManager

**Next Steps**: Phase 9 - Memory/RAG Integration (store skill usage history for narrative coherence)

---

## 2025-10-21: Skill System Phase 9 - Memory/RAG Integration

**Status**: Complete ✅

**Feature**: Store skill usage history in MemoryManager for narrative coherence

**Implementation**:
- ✅ SkillManager extended with MemoryManager integration:
  - Added optional memoryManager parameter to constructor
  - grantXp() logs skill practice events to memory (success/failure, XP gained, level)
  - checkSkill() logs skill check attempts to memory (roll, DC, margin, outcome)
  - unlockSkill() logs skill unlock events to memory (unlock method)
  - All events include metadata tags ("skill" → skillName, "event_type" → event category)
- ✅ PerkSelector extended with MemoryManager integration:
  - Added optional memoryManager parameter to constructor
  - selectPerk() logs perk unlock events to memory (perk name, skill, level)
  - Metadata includes skill, event_type, and perk name for filtering
- ✅ recallSkillHistory() helper method:
  - Suspend function in SkillManager for querying skill history
  - Supports skill-specific filtering via metadata
  - Uses MemoryManager.recallWithMetadata() for filtered searches
  - Returns list of skill events for narrative coherence
- ✅ Memory logging uses runBlocking for coroutine integration:
  - SkillManager methods are synchronous, MemoryManager methods are suspend
  - runBlocking ensures memory operations complete without blocking gameplay
  - Graceful handling when memoryManager is null (optional dependency)

**Files Modified**:
1. `reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/skill/SkillManager.kt`
   - Added memoryManager parameter (optional, nullable)
   - Added memory logging in grantXp() for XP and level-up events
   - Added memory logging in checkSkill() for skill check attempts (3 paths: no skill, opposed, regular)
   - Added memory logging in unlockSkill() for skill unlock events
   - Added recallSkillHistory() suspend function for querying skill history
2. `reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/skill/PerkSelector.kt`
   - Added memoryManager parameter (optional, nullable)
   - Added memory logging in selectPerk() for perk unlock events
   - Includes perk name in metadata for narrative callbacks

**Design Decisions**:
- MemoryManager is optional (nullable) for backward compatibility and testing
- Uses runBlocking to bridge synchronous game logic with async MemoryManager
- Metadata tagging enables filtered queries (e.g., recall only "Diplomacy" events)
- Event descriptions are human-readable for LLM narrative generation
- Supports both skill-specific and general skill history queries

**Memory Event Examples**:
- XP gained: "Practiced Diplomacy: success (+50 XP, level 3)"
- Level up: "Diplomacy leveled up from 2 to 3!"
- Skill check: "Attempted Diplomacy check: success (roll: 15+3 vs DC 15, margin: 3)"
- Skill unlock: "Unlocked Fire Magic via training!"
- Perk unlock: "Unlocked perk 'Quick Strike' for Sword Fighting at level 10"

**Integration Points**:
- Future narrative generators (NPCInteractionGenerator, CombatResolver) can call recallSkillHistory()
- RAG-enhanced combat narratives can reference skill progression
- NPC dialogue can mention past skill failures/successes
- Quest dialogue can acknowledge skill improvements

**Next Steps**: Phase 10 - Game Loop Integration (wire SkillManager into App.kt, EngineGameClient.kt, InMemoryGameEngine.kt with all 4 skill intents)

## Test Bot Validation Fixes - Round 2 & 3 (2025-10-11) 🔧

**Issue**: Exploration test scenario had false failures due to LLM validator misinterpreting valid game responses.
- **Initial**: 70% pass rate (14/20, 6 false failures)
- **After Round 2**: 85% pass rate (17/20, 3 false failures)
- **Round 3 goal**: 95%+ pass rate (19-20/20)

**Root Causes Identified**:
1. **LLM validator confusion about room entry** (Round 3) - Validator saw "Ancient Treasury" description after "go east" and thought player "remained in same room" or "entered again", when actually it was the FIRST successful entry
2. **Invalid direction rejection misunderstood** (Round 3) - Validator failed "You can't go that way" responses even when the direction was correctly invalid (e.g., "go south" when only "west" exit exists)
3. **No room transition tracking** (Round 2) - Validator couldn't see if player moved from "Room A" → "Room B"
4. **Missing explicit movement text** (Round 2) - Game shows new room directly, not "You move north"
5. **Validation rules not explicit enough** (Round 2 & 3) - LLM needed increasingly explicit instructions with real examples

**Changes Made** (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt`):

**Round 2 fixes** (lines 85-171):
1. Enhanced room tracking - Extract both current and previous room names from responses
2. Explicit transition detection - Show "ROOM CHANGED: X → Y" message in validation context
3. Strengthened validation rules - Added real examples from failed tests
4. Clear pass/fail criteria - Emphasized room description = successful movement

**Round 3 fixes** (lines 147-197):
1. **Ultra-explicit validation rules** - RULE 1-4 format in ALL CAPS with detailed explanations
2. **Real examples from actual failed validations** - Copied exact scenarios from step 7, 16, 20 failures
3. **Negative examples** - Show what SHOULD fail (crashes, rejections when exit exists)
4. **Triple emphasis on "DO NOT FAIL"** - Explicit warnings about room revisits, correct rejections, room descriptions after movement

**Failed Test Analysis** (from `test-logs/exploration_1760225557539_summary.txt`):
- **Step 7 & 16**: "go east" → "Ancient Treasury" description → Validator INCORRECTLY failed
  - Fixed: Added explicit example matching this scenario to validation rules
- **Step 20**: "go south" (invalid) → "You can't go that way" → Validator INCORRECTLY failed
  - Fixed: Emphasized checking game state exits BEFORE failing on rejections

**Technical Details**:
- Lines 93-107: Extract current and previous room names, filtering out "You..." responses
- Lines 121-133: Build room transition info showing explicit room changes
- Lines 147-197: Updated exploration scenario with RULE 1-4 format and real failure examples

**Status**: ✅ Round 3 fixes implemented and built. **Awaiting test run** to verify if LLM validator now understands.

## Item Interaction Test Fixes (2025-10-11) 🔧

**Problem**: Item interaction test had 38% pass rate (7/18) because it was testing non-existent items in the wrong location.

**Root Causes**:
1. **Wrong starting location** - Player spawned in Dungeon Entrance which has NO items
2. **Hallucinated items** - Test bot tried to interact with "healing potion", "mossy dagger", "rusty sword" that don't exist in that room
3. **Compound commands unsupported** - Commands like "look around and take sword" caused errors
4. **Repetitive failed attempts** - Bot kept trying "look around" 5 times expecting items to appear

**Solutions Applied**:

### 1. Test Spawn Location Support (`core/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/core/SampleDungeon.kt:269-301`)
```kotlin
fun createInitialWorldState(
    playerId: PlayerId = "player1",
    playerName: String = "Adventurer",
    startingRoomId: RoomId = STARTING_ROOM_ID  // NEW PARAMETER
): WorldState
```
- Added optional `startingRoomId` parameter to `createInitialWorldState()`
- ItemInteraction tests now spawn player directly in Armory (has 4 items: 2 weapons, 2 armor)
- Added room ID constants: `ARMORY_ROOM_ID`, `TREASURY_ROOM_ID`, `CORRIDOR_ROOM_ID`, etc.

### 2. Compound Command Handling (`perception/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/perception/IntentRecognizer.kt:21-55`)
```kotlin
private fun splitCompoundCommand(input: String): String {
    val separators = listOf(" and ", " then ", ", and ", ", then ", ",")
    for (separator in separators) {
        val parts = input.split(separator, ignoreCase = true, limit = 2)
        if (parts.size > 1) return parts[0].trim()
    }
    return input
}
```
- Extracts first action from compound commands before parsing
- Example: "take sword and equip it" → processes only "take sword"
- Handles "and", "then", commas as separators

### 3. Continue-on-Failure Behavior (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/TestModels.kt:50-75`)
- Tests now run ALL steps regardless of failures (no early termination)
- Final status determined by 80% pass rate threshold
- Updated test: `TestState continues despite failures()` verifies behavior

### 4. Item Test Strategy Updates
**InputGenerator** (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/InputGenerator.kt:121-148`):
- Lists exact items in Armory (Rusty Iron Sword, Sharp Steel Dagger, Worn Leather Armor, Heavy Chainmail)
- Clear test plan: look around → examine items → take → inventory → equip → drop → verify
- Instructions NOT to move rooms or retry failed commands
- Instructions NOT to use compound commands

**OutputValidator** (`testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt:338-364`):
- Validator knows player is in Armory with specific items
- Clear pass criteria: successful take/drop/equip actions, inventory tracking
- "You don't see that here" is VALID response for non-existent items
- FAIL only for crashes, items disappearing, wrong inventory contents

**Test Expectations**:
- ✅ Look around (see 4 items)
- ✅ Examine items before taking
- ✅ Take multiple items (weapons, armor)
- ✅ Inventory verification
- ✅ Equip weapon and armor
- ✅ Examine equipped items (shows "(equipped)" tag)
- ✅ Drop item
- ✅ Verify dropped item in room
- ✅ Take item back

**Files Changed**:
1. `core/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/core/SampleDungeon.kt` - Added startingRoomId parameter
2. `perception/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/perception/IntentRecognizer.kt` - Compound command splitting
3. `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/TestBotMain.kt` - Spawn in Armory for item tests
4. `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/InputGenerator.kt` - Item test guidance
5. `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt` - Item validation criteria
6. `testbot/src/test/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/TestModelsTest.kt` - Continue-on-failure test

**Status**: ✅ All fixes implemented and building. **Ready to test** - Run `gradle :testbot:run` → option 4

**Next Steps**:
1. Run `gradle :testbot:run` → option 4 to verify item interaction test now works properly
2. Expect 80%+ pass rate testing actual item mechanics (take, equip, drop, inventory)
3. Apply same testing improvements to other scenarios as needed

## Combat Turn Bug Fix (2025-10-12) 🔧

**Problem**: Combat test had 10% pass rate (2/20) - first attack succeeded, second attack succeeded, then all subsequent attacks failed with "It's not your turn!"

**Root Cause Analysis**:
From test logs (`test-logs/combat_1760287108686.txt`):
- Step 1: ✓ "attack Skeleton King" → "You engage Skeleton King in combat!" (PASS)
- Step 2: ✓ "attack Skeleton King" → "You strike for 14 damage! The enemy retaliates for 11 damage!" (PASS)
- Step 3-20: ✗ "attack Skeleton King" → "It's not your turn!" (FAIL)

**Bug Location** (`reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/CombatResolver.kt`):

**Line 83** (original):
```kotlin
val afterNpcAttack = updatedCombat.applyNpcDamage(npcDamage).nextTurn()
```

**Problem**: The `nextTurn()` method toggles `isPlayerTurn` flag:
```kotlin
fun nextTurn(): CombatState = copy(
    isPlayerTurn = !isPlayerTurn,  // Flips to false after NPC counter
    turnCount = turnCount + 1
)
```

**Turn Flow Bug**:
1. Combat starts: `isPlayerTurn = true`
2. Player attacks → NPC counters → `.nextTurn()` called → `isPlayerTurn = false`
3. Next attack command → Check `if (!combat.isPlayerTurn)` → "It's not your turn!"
4. Player permanently locked out of combat

**Solution Applied** (`CombatResolver.kt:81-83, 136-138`):

Removed `.nextTurn()` calls in two locations:
1. **Line 83** - After NPC counterattack in normal combat round
2. **Line 138** - After NPC attack when flee attempt fails

**New behavior** - Simultaneous turn-based system:
- Player attacks → NPC counters **immediately** → Player can attack again
- `isPlayerTurn` remains `true` throughout combat
- No waiting for "turns" - player is always allowed to act

**Code Changes**:
```kotlin
// Before (line 83):
val afterNpcAttack = updatedCombat.applyNpcDamage(npcDamage).nextTurn()

// After (line 83):
val afterNpcAttack = updatedCombat.applyNpcDamage(npcDamage)
// Comment: (simultaneous turn - player can attack again immediately)
```

**Files Modified**:
- `reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/CombatResolver.kt` (lines 81-83, 136-138)

**Build Status**: ✅ `gradle :reasoning:build` and `gradle :app:installDist` successful

**Expected Test Results**:
- Combat test should now show 90%+ pass rate
- Players can continuously attack until enemy dies or player dies
- No more "It's not your turn!" errors during continuous combat

**Status**: ✅ Fix implemented and built. **Ready to test** - Run `gradle :testbot:run` → option 2 (Combat)

## Combat Test Validation Fix (2025-10-12) 🎯

**Problem**: Combat test had 30% pass rate (6/20) - combat mechanics worked correctly but test validator incorrectly failed most steps.

**Pattern from logs** (`test-logs/combat_1760306000586.txt`):
- Steps 1-4: Combat works (initiate → rounds → killing blow) ✅ PASS
- Step 5: "No one by that name here" after NPC death ✅ PASS
- Steps 6-20: Same response but validator fails ❌ FAIL
- Validator: "Skeleton King is not present when it should be...should still be in combat"

**Root Causes**:
1. **No explicit victory signal** - "You strike for X damage!" was ambiguous (killing blow vs normal hit)
2. **Brittle pattern detection** - Validator tried to infer NPC death from combat history patterns
3. **LLM confusion** - "attack" with no target → "Attack whom?" failed because LLM thought combat should be ongoing

**Solution 1 - Hardcoded Victory Marker**:

Added explicit death signal in `CombatResolver.kt:72`:
```kotlin
// Before:
narrative = "You strike for $damage damage!"

// After:
narrative = "You strike for $damage damage! Your enemy has been defeated!"
```

**Solution 2 - Query Game State Directly**:

Updated `OutputValidator.kt:358-426` to use explicit signals and query state:
- **Line 362-370**: Check "attack" with no target → "Attack whom?" = PASS
- **Line 380**: Check for "has been defeated" marker = PASS (victory)
- **Line 364-367**: Query `worldState.getCurrentRoom()` to check if NPC is in room
- **Line 415-421**: If NPC not in room, it was killed = PASS (correctly rejected)

**Removed brittle code**:
- Deleted `trackKilledNPCsFromHistory()` function that tried to detect deaths from patterns
- No more regex pattern matching on combat responses
- No more analyzing history for victory indicators

**Design Philosophy Applied**:
- ✅ **Explicit signals** (hardcoded markers) over implicit pattern inference
- ✅ **Query state directly** instead of analyzing history
- ✅ Follows `CLAUDE_GUIDELINES.md`: "prefer explicit over implicit", "no regex as LLM backups"

**Files Modified**:
- `reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/CombatResolver.kt:72` - Added victory marker
- `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt:358-426` - Simplified validation

**Test Results**: ✅ **100% pass rate** (20/20 steps)
- Previous: 30% pass rate (6/20 steps)
- Improvement: +70% pass rate
- All combat scenarios validate correctly

**Build Status**: ✅ `gradle :reasoning:assemble :testbot:assemble` successful

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Combat test validation achieves 100% reliability

## Combat Narration Improvements (2025-10-12) 🎨

**Feature**: Combat narration now uses equipment-aware, concise descriptions!

**Problems Addressed**:
1. Combat text was too long and wordy
2. Player and enemy attacks ran together on same line (hard to read)
3. Generic weapon references (e.g., "blade") when player had no weapon equipped

**Solutions Applied** (`reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/CombatNarrator.kt`):

### 1. Equipment-Aware Narration (lines 50-52, 119, 141-155)
```kotlin
// LLM prompt now includes:
appendLine("  - Weapon: ${worldState.player.equippedWeapon?.name ?: "bare fists"}")
appendLine("  - Armor: ${worldState.player.equippedArmor?.name ?: "no armor"}")
appendLine("  - STR: ${worldState.player.stats.strength}, DEX: ${worldState.player.stats.dexterity}")
```

**Fallback narratives** now handle unarmed vs armed combat:
```kotlin
if (weapon == "bare fists") {
    "${npc.name} attacks! You raise your fists to defend yourself!"
} else {
    "${npc.name} attacks! You ready your $weapon!"
}
```

### 2. Shorter, Line-Separated Text (lines 36, 40, 82, 167-177)
- **Reduced max tokens**: 150 → 80 for more concise responses
- **Explicit line-break instruction**: "Put each attack on its own line. First line: player's attack. Second line: enemy's counter (if any)."
- **Fallback uses appendLine()**: Separates player attack from enemy counter-attack

### 3. Better Prompting (line 74)
```kotlin
appendLine("Narrate this combat round in 1-2 SHORT sentences per attack. Put player attack on one line, enemy counter on next line. Use the player's actual weapon (or fists if unarmed). Do not include damage numbers.")
```

**Result**:
- ✅ Combat descriptions are now 1-2 SHORT sentences per action
- ✅ Each attack appears on separate line for clarity
- ✅ References actual equipped gear (weapons, armor)
- ✅ Handles unarmed combat properly ("bare fists" instead of generic "blade")
- ✅ More readable combat log in GUI client

**Files Modified**:
- `reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/CombatNarrator.kt` (lines 36-52, 74, 82, 104-155, 167-177)

  - No changes needed - already set up from social system

✅ **Comprehensive Unit Tests** - 34 behavioral tests for SkillState
  - File: `core/src/test/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/core/SkillStateTest.kt`
  - XP calculation tests (levels 1, 10, 50, 100, 101, 200)
  - Level-up threshold detection and multi-level jumps
  - Unlock logic and immutability verification
  - Effective level with buffs
  - Perk milestone detection and pending choices
  - Edge cases: zero XP, negative XP, resource types, tags
  - All 34 tests passing

**XP Progression Design**:
- **Early game** (L1-L10): ~5,000 XP total - accessible progression
- **Mid game** (L50-L60): ~185,000 XP per level - meaningful grind
- **Late game** (L100+): Millions of XP per level - infinite scaling
- **Godlike progression**: No hard caps, exponential scaling after L100

**Perk Milestone System**:
- Every 10 levels: player chooses 1 of 2 perks
- hasPendingPerkChoice() detects unclaimed perks
- Perks stored in SkillState for persistence

**Phase 1 Deliverables Complete**:
1. ✅ SkillState.kt - XP calculation, leveling, buffs, perks (134 lines)
2. ✅ SkillComponent.kt - Skill container for entities (100 lines)
3. ✅ SkillEvent.kt - Event hierarchy for skill tracking (82 lines)
4. ✅ SkillStateTest.kt - 34 comprehensive unit tests
5. ✅ ComponentType.SKILL already present

**Build Status**: ✅ All core module tests passing (127 tests = 93 existing + 34 new)

**Status**: ✅ **PHASE 1 COMPLETE** - Foundation ready for Phase 2 (Database Layer)

**Next Steps**: Phase 2 - Database Layer (SkillDatabase, SQLiteSkillRepository, SQLiteSkillComponentRepository with 3-table schema)

## Skill System V2 - Phase 2: Database Layer (2025-10-20) 🗄️

**Feature**: SQLite persistence for skills with repository pattern and 3-table schema

✅ **SkillDatabase** - SQLite connection management and schema creation
  - File: `memory/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/memory/skill/SkillDatabase.kt`
  - Schema with 3 tables: skill_components, skills, skill_events_log
  - skill_components: JSON-serialized complete SkillComponent state
  - skills: Denormalized table for fast queries (entity_id, skill_name, level, xp, etc.)
  - skill_events_log: Event history with timestamps for analytics
  - Proper indexes for query performance (entity_id, skill_name, tags, timestamp)

✅ **SkillRepository Interface** - Repository contract for skill data persistence
  - File: `core/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/core/repository/SkillRepository.kt`
  - Methods: findByEntityAndSkill(), findByEntityId(), findByTag()
  - CRUD: save(), updateXp(), unlockSkill(), delete(), deleteAllForEntity()
  - Event logging: logEvent(), getEventHistory()
  - Result types for error handling
  - Supports skill queries, XP updates, and event tracking

✅ **SQLiteSkillRepository** - Repository implementation for denormalized skills table
  - File: `memory/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/memory/skill/SQLiteSkillRepository.kt`
  - All CRUD operations with parameterized queries
  - Tag-based queries using LIKE for JSON array searching
  - Event history with timestamp ordering and limits
  - SkillEvent serialization/deserialization for polymorphic storage
  - JSON encoding for tags, perks, and event data

✅ **SkillComponentRepository Interface** - Repository contract for complete skill components
  - File: `core/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/core/repository/SkillComponentRepository.kt`
  - Methods: save(), load(), delete(), findAll()
  - Simpler than SkillRepository - handles full component state
  - JSON-based persistence for entire skill map

✅ **SQLiteSkillComponentRepository** - Repository implementation for skill components
  - File: `memory/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/memory/skill/SQLiteSkillComponentRepository.kt`
  - Stores complete SkillComponent as JSON
  - Parameterized queries for safety
  - Result types for error handling
  - Efficient bulk operations (findAll)

✅ **Comprehensive Database Tests** - 18 tests covering all repository operations
  - File: `memory/src/test/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/memory/skill/SkillDatabaseTest.kt`
  - SkillRepository tests (12 tests):
    - Save/find skills by entity and name
    - Find all skills for entity
    - Tag-based queries
    - XP updates
    - Unlock operations
    - Delete operations
    - Event logging
    - Event history queries (with pagination and filtering)
  - SkillComponentRepository tests (6 tests):
    - Save/load complete components
    - Delete operations
    - FindAll operations
    - Complex perk data persistence
    - Resource type skill storage
  - All 18 tests passing with in-memory SQLite

**Database Schema Design**:
- **skill_components**: Primary storage for complete SkillComponent JSON
- **skills**: Denormalized for fast queries without JSON parsing
- **skill_events_log**: Event sourcing pattern for analytics and debugging
- **Indexes**: Optimized for common queries (by entity, by skill, by tag, by time)

**Phase 2 Deliverables Complete**:
1. ✅ SkillDatabase.kt - SQLite schema and connection management (102 lines)
2. ✅ SkillRepository.kt - Repository interface (58 lines)
3. ✅ SkillComponentRepository.kt - Component repository interface (28 lines)
4. ✅ SQLiteSkillRepository.kt - Skill repository implementation (256 lines)
5. ✅ SQLiteSkillComponentRepository.kt - Component repository implementation (92 lines)
6. ✅ SkillDatabaseTest.kt - 18 comprehensive database tests (302 lines)

**Build Status**: ✅ All memory module tests passing (18 new tests)

**Status**: ✅ **PHASE 2 COMPLETE** - Database layer ready for Phase 3 (Skill Manager - Core Logic)

**Next Steps**: Phase 3 - Skill Manager (grantXp, unlockSkill, checkSkill methods with 20-25 tests)
