# Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Enhanced MVP with LLM Integration + Items + NPC Dialogue ‚ú®

## Overview

The AI-powered MUD engine is now fully playable with LLM-generated room descriptions, NPC dialogue, and item mechanics. The core architecture is in place, and the game demonstrates the vision outlined in `requirements.txt`.

## Completed Features

### ‚úÖ Core Architecture (100%)

- **Multi-module Gradle setup** with 6 modules following clean architecture
- **Immutable state design** with `WorldState` and `PlayerState`
- **Sealed class hierarchies** for type-safe intent handling
- **Java 17 toolchain** with Kotlin 2.2.0
- **ktor 3.1.0** for HTTP client (OpenAI API)

### ‚úÖ World Model (100%)

- **Room system** with traits, exits, entities, and properties
- **Direction enum** with bidirectional mapping and display names
- **Entity hierarchy**: Base Entity, Item, NPC with health/hostility
- **Sample dungeon**: 6 interconnected rooms with rich trait lists
  - Dungeon Entrance (with Old Guard NPC - friendly)
  - Dark Corridor (hub with 4 exits)
  - Ancient Treasury (with gold pouch item)
  - Forgotten Armory (with iron sword item)
  - Abandoned Throne Room (with Skeleton King NPC - hostile)
  - Hidden Chamber (magical secret area)

### ‚úÖ LLM Integration (100%)

- **OpenAI client** (`llm` module) with ktor HTTP client
- **RoomDescriptionGenerator** (`reasoning` module)
  - GPT-4o-mini model for cost efficiency
  - Temperature 0.8 for creative variation
  - 200 token max per description
  - Fallback to simple trait concatenation on failure
- **NPCInteractionGenerator** (`reasoning` module)
  - GPT-4o-mini model for cost efficiency
  - Temperature 0.9 for varied dialogue
  - 150 token max per response
  - Personality-driven based on NPC disposition and health
  - Fallback to simple responses
- **Prompt engineering** for atmospheric, second-person narratives and in-character dialogue
- **API key configuration** via `local.properties` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var
- **Comprehensive tests** with mock LLM client

### ‚úÖ Input Parsing (100%)

- **Intent sealed class hierarchy**:
  - `Move(direction: Direction)`
  - `Look(target: String?)`
  - `Interact(target: String)`
  - `Take(target: String)` - new!
  - `Drop(target: String)` - new!
  - `Talk(target: String)` - new!
  - `Inventory`
  - `Help`
  - `Quit`
  - `Invalid(message: String)`
- **Text parser** supporting natural language shortcuts
  - Directional: `n`, `north`, `go north`, etc.
  - Actions: `look`, `l`, `inventory`, `i`
  - Items: `take`, `get`, `pickup`, `drop`, `put`
  - NPCs: `talk`, `speak`, `chat`
  - Help: `help`, `h`, `?`

### ‚úÖ Game Loop (100%)

- **Console interface** with welcome message
- **Command processing** with intent-based dispatch
- **Room descriptions** with LLM-generated narratives
- **Movement system** with exit validation
- **Entity listing** (items and NPCs visible in rooms)
- **Look at entities** with targeted examination
- **Item pickup/drop** with fuzzy name matching
- **NPC dialogue** with LLM-powered personality-driven responses
- **Inventory display**
- **Help system**
- **Graceful quit** with confirmation

### ‚úÖ Item System (100%)

- **Item mechanics**: Pick up items from rooms, drop items to rooms
- **Inventory management**: Track items carried by player
- **Fuzzy matching**: "take gold" matches "Heavy Gold Pouch"
- **Validation**: Check `isPickupable` flag on items
- **State immutability**: Proper WorldState updates for item transfers

### ‚úÖ NPC Interaction (100%)

- **Talk to NPCs**: Engage in dialogue with entities
- **Personality-driven dialogue**: LLM considers disposition (hostile/friendly)
- **Health-aware responses**: NPCs mention condition if wounded
- **Contextual awareness**: Dialogue considers player and NPC states
- **Fallback mode**: Simple responses when LLM unavailable

### üü° Combat System (0%)

**Specified in requirements, not yet implemented**:
- Turn-based combat
- Initiative system
- Attack/defend mechanics
- LLM-generated combat narratives
- Enemy AI via LLM decision-making

## Technical Debt

### Low Priority

- SLF4J warnings (no logger configured - acceptable for MVP)
- No caching for LLM responses (each `look` regenerates)
- Hardcoded sample dungeon (should be loadable from JSON/YAML)

### Medium Priority

- Game loop is synchronous (blocking on LLM calls)
- No error handling for network failures beyond fallback descriptions
- API key visible in JVM args (`ps aux` would show it)

### High Priority

- **None currently** - MVP is solid

## Performance

- **Room descriptions**: ~300-350 tokens per call
- **NPC dialogue**: ~220-260 tokens per call
- **Response time**: 1-3 seconds per LLM call (network dependent)
- **Cost**: ~$0.0002 per room description, ~$0.00015 per NPC dialogue with gpt-4o-mini
- **Fallback**: Instant (simple string concatenation/responses)

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Combat System (Current Priority)

1. ‚úÖ ~~Item mechanics~~ - COMPLETE
2. ‚úÖ ~~NPC dialogue system~~ - COMPLETE
3. Basic turn-based combat mechanics
4. LLM-generated combat narratives
5. Enemy AI decisions via LLM
6. Health/damage mechanics integration

### Phase 2: Item Usage & Advanced Interactions

1. Item usage system (equip sword, drink potion)
2. Object interactions (open chest, search room)
3. Item properties and effects

### Phase 3: Memory & RAG

1. Vector database integration
2. Store conversation/action history
3. Retrieve context for LLM prompts
4. Maintain coherence across sessions

| Skills/interactions | üü° Partial | Talk to NPCs complete, object interaction pending |
| Combat system | ‚ùå Not started | Data model ready, mechanics missing |
| RAG for history | ‚ùå Not started | Memory module exists but empty |
| Variability in output | ‚úÖ Complete | Temp 0.8 (rooms), 0.9 (NPCs), varied each time |
| Console I/O | ‚úÖ Complete | Working game loop with text interface |
| Immutable state | ‚úÖ Complete | `WorldState` is immutable, helpers create copies |

**Overall Alignment**: 75% of MVP requirements complete, strong progress toward full implementation.

## Conclusion

The AI MUD engine has achieved major milestones: **playable MVP with LLM-powered room descriptions, NPC dialogue, and item mechanics**. The core architecture is solid, the sample dungeon is engaging, and the LLM integration demonstrates the vision effectively.

NPCs now feel alive with personality-driven dialogue that responds to their disposition and health status. Players can pick up items, manage inventory, and interact with the world in meaningful ways.

Next priority is implementing the combat system to enable tactical encounters with the Skeleton King and future hostile NPCs.
