# Implementation Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-10-10
**Status**: Enhanced MVP with LLM Integration ‚ú®

## Overview

The AI-powered MUD engine is now fully playable with LLM-generated room descriptions. The core architecture is in place, and the game demonstrates the vision outlined in `requirements.txt`.

## Completed Features

### ‚úÖ Core Architecture (100%)

- **Multi-module Gradle setup** with 6 modules following clean architecture
- **Immutable state design** with `WorldState` and `PlayerState`
- **Sealed class hierarchies** for type-safe intent handling
- **Java 17 toolchain** with Kotlin 2.2.0
- **ktor 3.1.0** for HTTP client (OpenAI API)

### ‚úÖ World Model (100%)

- **Room system** with traits, exits, entities, and properties
- **Direction enum** with bidirectional mapping and display names
- **Entity hierarchy**: Base Entity, Item, NPC with health/hostility
- **Sample dungeon**: 6 interconnected rooms with rich trait lists
  - Dungeon Entrance
  - Dark Corridor (hub with 4 exits)
  - Ancient Treasury (with gold pouch)
  - Forgotten Armory (with iron sword)
  - Abandoned Throne Room (with Skeleton King NPC)
  - Hidden Chamber (magical secret area)

### ‚úÖ LLM Integration (100%)

- **OpenAI client** (`llm` module) with ktor HTTP client
- **RoomDescriptionGenerator** (`reasoning` module)
  - GPT-4o-mini model for cost efficiency
  - Temperature 0.8 for creative variation
  - 200 token max per description
  - Fallback to simple trait concatenation on failure
- **Prompt engineering** for atmospheric, second-person narratives
- **API key configuration** via `local.properties` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` env var
- **Comprehensive tests** with mock LLM client

### ‚úÖ Input Parsing (100%)

- **Intent sealed class hierarchy**:
  - `Move(direction: Direction)`
  - `Look(target: String?)`
  - `Interact(target: String)`
  - `Inventory`
  - `Help`
  - `Quit`
  - `Invalid(message: String)`
- **Text parser** supporting natural language shortcuts
  - Directional: `n`, `north`, `go north`, etc.
  - Actions: `look`, `l`, `inventory`, `i`
  - Help: `help`, `h`, `?`

### ‚úÖ Game Loop (100%)

- **Console interface** with welcome message
- **Command processing** with intent-based dispatch
- **Room descriptions** with LLM-generated narratives
- **Movement system** with exit validation
- **Entity listing** (items and NPCs visible in rooms)
- **Look at entities** with targeted examination
- **Inventory display**
- **Help system**
- **Graceful quit** with confirmation

## Partially Implemented

### üü° Interaction System (30%)

**Implemented**:
- Look at specific entities
- Entity descriptions stored in data model

**TODO**:
- Item pickup/drop mechanics
- NPC dialogue system
- Object interaction (chests, doors, etc.)
- Item usage (weapons, potions, etc.)

### üü° Combat System (0%)

**Specified in requirements, not yet implemented**:
- Turn-based combat
- Initiative system
- Attack/defend mechanics
- LLM-generated combat narratives
- Enemy AI via LLM decision-making
- Health/damage system (data model exists, mechanics don't)

### üü° Skills System (0%)

**Specified in requirements, not yet implemented**:
- Skill checks (search, perception, etc.)
- Dice rolling mechanics
- Success/failure outcomes
- Trap detection and disarming

## Not Yet Implemented

### ‚ùå Memory/RAG Integration (0%)

**Planned**:
- Vector database for conversation history
- Context retrieval for LLM prompts
- Persistent world state
- Player action history
- Coherence across descriptions

### ‚ùå Advanced LLM Features (0%)

**Planned**:
- LLM-based input parsing (currently regex/string matching)
- Agentic loops (ReAct pattern)
- Dynamic event generation
- NPC personality via LLM
- Adaptive difficulty

### ‚ùå Multi-player Support (0%)

**Future consideration**:
- Shared world state
- Per-player positions
- Discord bot integration
- Concurrent session handling

## Code Quality

### Test Coverage

- ‚úÖ **Intent hierarchy**: Comprehensive tests in `perception` module
- ‚úÖ **RoomDescriptionGenerator**: Mock-based tests with success/failure cases
- ‚úÖ **Core models**: Basic validation (more needed)
- ‚ùå **Game loop**: No tests yet (manual testing only)
- ‚ùå **Integration tests**: End-to-end scenarios not automated

### Documentation

- ‚úÖ **README.md**: Up-to-date with quick start guide
- ‚úÖ **CLAUDE.md**: Current implementation status for AI assistant
- ‚úÖ **TODO.md**: Prioritized task list
- ‚úÖ **CLAUDE_GUIDELINES.md**: Development principles
- ‚úÖ **requirements.txt**: Original vision document (still relevant)
- ‚úÖ **IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md**: This file

## Technical Debt

### Low Priority

- SLF4J warnings (no logger configured - acceptable for MVP)
- No caching for LLM responses (each `look` regenerates)
- Hardcoded sample dungeon (should be loadable from JSON/YAML)

### Medium Priority

- Game loop is synchronous (blocking on LLM calls)
- No error handling for network failures beyond fallback descriptions
- API key visible in JVM args (`ps aux` would show it)

### High Priority

- **None currently** - MVP is solid

## Performance

- **LLM calls**: ~300-350 tokens per room description
- **Response time**: 1-3 seconds per description (network dependent)
- **Cost**: ~$0.0002 per description with gpt-4o-mini
- **Fallback**: Instant (simple string concatenation)

## Next Steps (Prioritized)

### Phase 1: Item Mechanics (Next Sprint)

1. Implement `pickup <item>` command
2. Implement `drop <item>` command
3. Update inventory management
4. Add item weight/capacity limits (optional)
5. Test with sample dungeon items

### Phase 2: Enhanced Interactions

1. NPC dialogue system (talk to Skeleton King)
2. Object interactions (open chest, search room)
3. Item usage (equip sword, drink potion)

### Phase 3: Combat System

1. Basic turn-based combat
2. LLM-generated combat narratives
3. Enemy AI decisions via LLM
4. Health/damage mechanics

### Phase 4: Memory & RAG

1. Vector database integration
2. Store conversation/action history
3. Retrieve context for LLM prompts
4. Maintain coherence across sessions

## Alignment with Requirements

Reviewing `docs/requirements.txt`:

| Requirement | Status | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| Room graph with traits | ‚úÖ Complete | `Room` data class with traits, exits, entities |
| Dynamic LLM descriptions | ‚úÖ Complete | `RoomDescriptionGenerator` with gpt-4o-mini |
| Natural language input | üü° Partial | Text parser works, but not LLM-based yet |
| Exploration (move, look) | ‚úÖ Complete | Full movement system with descriptions |
| Skills/interactions | ‚ùå Not started | Placeholder for interact command only |
| Combat system | ‚ùå Not started | Data model ready, mechanics missing |
| RAG for history | ‚ùå Not started | Memory module exists but empty |
| Variability in output | ‚úÖ Complete | Temperature 0.8, new descriptions each time |
| Console I/O | ‚úÖ Complete | Working game loop with text interface |
| Immutable state | ‚úÖ Complete | `WorldState` is immutable, helpers create copies |

**Overall Alignment**: 60% of MVP requirements complete, on track for full implementation.

## Conclusion

The AI MUD engine has achieved its first major milestone: **playable MVP with LLM-powered descriptions**. The core architecture is solid, the sample dungeon is engaging, and the LLM integration demonstrates the vision effectively.

Next priorities are item mechanics and interaction systems to make the world more interactive before tackling combat and RAG integration.
