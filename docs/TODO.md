## Next Actions

**🚧 In Progress: World System V3 - Graph-Based Navigation**

Starting implementation of V3 upgrade to world generation system. See `docs/requirements/V3/FEATURE_PLAN_world_system_v3.md` for complete plan.

**Completed Chunks**:
- ✅ Chunk 1: GraphNodeComponent and Data Structures - GRAPH_NODE enum, GraphNodeComponent.kt with 155 lines (29 tests passing), GraphTypes.kt with NodeType sealed class and EdgeData, documented in ARCHITECTURE.md
- ✅ Chunk 2: Database Schema and GraphNodeRepository - graph_nodes table in WorldDatabase.kt, GraphNodeRepository.kt interface, SQLiteGraphNodeRepository.kt with 219 lines (29 unit tests), ARCHITECTURE.md updated
- ✅ Chunk 3: Graph Generation Algorithms - GraphLayout.kt sealed class (Grid/BSP/FloodFill), GraphGenerator.kt with layout algorithms (grid, BSP, flood-fill), Kruskal MST for connectivity, 20% extra edges for loops, node type assignment, 15-25% hidden edges, comprehensive unit tests (GraphGeneratorTest.kt with 31 tests, GraphLayoutTest.kt with 25 tests), ARCHITECTURE.md updated
- ✅ Chunk 4: Graph Validation System - GraphValidator.kt with 212 lines, ValidationResult sealed class (Success, Failure), isFullyConnected() BFS check, hasLoop() DFS cycle detection, avgDegree() calculation (>= 3.0 threshold), frontierCount() validation (>= 2), comprehensive unit tests (GraphValidatorTest.kt with 20 tests), WORLD_GENERATION.md updated with validation criteria
- ✅ Chunk 5: Integrate Graph Generation with World System - **V3 WorldState refactoring in progress** (Option 2: Full ECS replacement):
  - ✅ WorldGenerator.kt updated with `generateChunk()` - generates graph at SUBZONE level (lines 78-85)
  - ✅ `generateGraphTopology()` - Graph generation with layout selection, seeded RNG, validation (lines 96-127)
  - ✅ `generateSpaceStub()` - creates space stubs with empty descriptions for lazy-fill (lines 211-252)
  - ✅ `fillSpaceContent()` - on-demand LLM generation when player enters space (lines 264-287)
  - ✅ `generateNodeDescription()` - LLM-based description using node type, exits, chunk lore (lines 293-341)
  - ✅ `determineNodeProperties()` - Node type-based brightness/terrain determination (lines 343-360)
  - ✅ `ChunkGenerationResult` data class - returns chunk + graph nodes (lines 562-566)
  - ✅ Graph validation before persistence in `generateGraphTopology()`
  - ✅ **WorldState.kt V3 Refactoring** (248 lines) - Full ECS component integration:
    - Added `graphNodes: Map<SpaceId, GraphNodeComponent>` - Graph topology storage
    - Added `spaces: Map<SpaceId, SpacePropertiesComponent>` - Space content storage
    - Deprecated `rooms` field (marked for removal after migration)
    - **V3 Methods** (12 new methods):
      - `getCurrentSpace()` / `getCurrentGraphNode()` - Component-based location queries
      - `getSpace()` / `getGraphNode()` - Direct component access
      - `updateSpace()` / `updateGraphNode()` - Immutable component updates
      - `addSpace()` - Combined node + space addition
      - `movePlayerV3()` - Graph-based navigation using GraphNodeComponent edges
      - `getAvailableExitsV3()` - Perception-aware exit listing
      - `addEntityToSpaceV3()` / `removeEntityFromSpaceV3()` - Entity management
    - **Migration Strategy**: Incremental - V2 methods remain alongside V3 for gradual handler migration
    - Compiles successfully with deprecation warnings on V2 methods

  **Architectural Decision: Option 2 (Full ECS Replacement) - In Progress**
  - V3 replaces V2 entirely (no parallel systems, no migrations)
  - Database can be wiped between versions
  - WorldState refactored to use ECS components directly
  - Room abstraction deprecated (will be removed after handler migration)

  **Remaining Integration Work** (Est. 11-14h):
  - ❌ **Movement Handlers** (~3-3.5h) - **READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**:
    **✅ V3 Dependencies Added** (MudGameEngine.kt lines 126-142):
    - ✅ LoreInheritanceEngine(llmClient) - for WorldGenerator
    - ✅ GraphGenerator(rng, difficultyLevel) - for V3 graph topology
    - ✅ GraphValidator() - for V3 graph validation
    - ✅ WorldGenerator(llmClient, loreEngine, graphGenerator, graphValidator) - accessible as `game.worldGenerator`

    **Console MovementHandlers.kt** (app/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/app/handlers/MovementHandlers.kt):
    - Update `handleMove()` (line 15):
      - Try V3 path: check `getCurrentGraphNode()`, use `movePlayerV3(direction)`
      - Lazy-fill: After move, check if `space.description.isEmpty()`, call `worldGenerator.fillSpaceContent()`
      - Frontier traversal: Check if moved to frontier node, generate new chunk if needed
      - Fall back to V2 `movePlayer()` if V3 not available
    - Update `handleLook()` (line 37): try `getCurrentSpace()` before `getCurrentRoom()`
    - Update `handleSearch()` (line 67): try `getCurrentSpace()` before `getCurrentRoom()`

    **Client ClientMovementHandlers.kt** (client/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/client/handlers/ClientMovementHandlers.kt):
    - Already has partial V3 support via `currentSpace()` helper (line 15)
    - Update `handleMove()` to use `movePlayerV3()` instead of manual player.copy() (line 28, 393)
    - Add lazy-fill check after movement
    - Add frontier traversal logic for chunk cascade

    **Implementation Order**:
    1. Add V3 dependencies to MudGame (LoreInheritanceEngine, GraphGenerator, GraphValidator, WorldGenerator)
    2. Update console MovementHandlers.kt with V3 support + V2 fallback
    3. Update client ClientMovementHandlers.kt to use movePlayerV3()
    4. Test compilation and basic movement
    5. Add integration tests for lazy-fill and frontier traversal

  - ❌ **Item/Combat/Social Handlers** (~4-5h):
    - Update `ItemHandlers.kt` to use `getCurrentSpace()` / `updateSpace()`
    - Update `CombatHandlers.kt` to use SpacePropertiesComponent for entity access
    - Update `SocialHandlers.kt` to use V3 space methods
    - Update `SkillQuestHandlers.kt` for V3 compatibility

  - ❌ **Game Loop** (~2-3h):
    - Update `MudGameEngine.kt` to initialize with V3 WorldState
    - Update `MultiUserGame.kt` for V3 compatibility
    - Update world generation entry points to use V3 generation

  - ❌ **GUI Client** (~2-3h):
    - Update `EngineGameClient.kt` and all client handlers for V3
    - Update character creation to spawn in V3-generated world

  - ❌ **Remove V2 Code** (~1h):
    - Remove deprecated `rooms` field from WorldState
    - Remove V2 Room-based methods (getCurrentRoom, movePlayer, etc.)
    - Remove GraphToRoomAdapter (no longer needed with full ECS)
    - Update all tests to use V3 methods

  - ❌ **Integration Tests** (~2h):
    - End-to-end test: Generate chunk with graph → navigate → verify lazy-fill
    - Frontier cascade test: Enter frontier node → verify new chunk created
    - Save/load test: Verify graph + space persistence
    - Multi-user test: Verify V3 works with concurrent players

**Next Step**:
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: WorldState V3 refactoring - ECS component storage added
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Movement handlers requirements documented (see detailed plan above)
3. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Add V3 dependencies to MudGame - LoreInheritanceEngine, GraphGenerator, GraphValidator, WorldGenerator added (MudGameEngine.kt:126-142, compiles successfully)
4. ❌ **IMPLEMENT**: Update console MovementHandlers.kt with V3 support (~1-1.5h)
5. ❌ **IMPLEMENT**: Update client ClientMovementHandlers.kt with V3 support (~1-1.5h)
6. ❌ **TEST**: Movement integration tests (~30min)
7. ❌ **Update remaining handlers** for V3 compatibility (~4-5h)
8. ❌ **Update game loop and clients** for V3 (~4-6h)
9. ❌ **Remove deprecated V2 code** and add integration tests (~3h)

**Note**: V3 is a full architectural replacement requiring ~12-15h of work across all handlers, game loop, and clients. WorldState foundation is complete and compiles successfully.
