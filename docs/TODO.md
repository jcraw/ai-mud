- [ ] Additional quest types (Escort, Defend, Craft)
- [ ] Character progression (leveling, skill trees)
- [ ] More dungeon themes and variations

## Notes

**Project Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

All systems complete and tested. Game is fully playable with 773 tests passing (100% pass rate).

**Development Notes**:
- No backward compatibility needed - can wipe and restart data between versions
- Multi-user mode intentionally uses simplified combat (design choice for MVP)
- Optional test coverage improvements available for Starting Dungeon components (non-blocking)
