Client UI Requirements for Roleplaying Engine
This requirements spec outlines a Compose Multiplatform UI client for interacting with the MUD-style roleplaying engine. The UI enables character selection and gameplay via a text-based interface: a scrollable log for history (system outputs like room/combat descriptions + player actions) and an input field for natural language commands. Designed for single-player MVP, it replaces console I/O while keeping the engine scalable (e.g., to Discord). Use Kotlin/Compose; unidirectional flow with immutable UI state. Keep modules small, KISS.
1. Overview

Purpose: User-facing client to play the game—select character, view immersive log, input actions. Enhances UX over console with scrolling, formatting, auto-focus.
Key Features:

Character Selection: Dropdown or cards for premade chars (e.g., Warrior, Rogue).
Log Window: Scrollable, formatted text pane showing interleaved history (player inputs bold/italic, system narratives plain, with timestamps).
Input Field: Text box for commands; submit on Enter, with history recall (up/down arrows).
UX Niceties: Auto-scroll to new content; dark/light theme toggle (fantasy aesthetic: muted colors, serif fonts); status bar for char stats (HP, position); clear button for input; copy log to clipboard.


Tech:

Compose Multiplatform (desktop target for MVP; scalable to mobile/web).
Integrate with engine: Use engine's InputOutputHandler abstraction—implement UI version (e.g., coroutines for async updates).
State: Immutable UiState(logEntries: List<LogEntry>, currentChar: Character?, status: Status) exposed via ViewModel.


Changes to Engine:

Make I/O pluggable: Expose interface GameClient { fun sendInput(text: String); fun observeOutput(): Flow<String> } for UI to hook in.
Add structured outputs: Engine emits events (e.g., sealed class GameEvent { class Narrative(text: String) : GameEvent() ... }) for better UI formatting.
Persistence: Save/load session state for UI resumes.
Async: Use Flows/Coroutines for real-time updates without blocking UI.



2. Functional Requirements
2.1 Screens/Components

Character Selection Screen:

Display on startup: Grid/cards of premade chars (name, desc, stats).
Select via click; confirm starts game, transitions to main screen.
LLM integration: If needed, generate char bios dynamically.


Main Gameplay Screen:

Log Window: Composable Scrollable Column/Text; append entries on output. Format: Player actions prefixed "You: ", system as narrative blocks. Auto-scroll; infinite scroll for long sessions.
Input Field: TextField at bottom; submit sends to engine. Features: Auto-complete suggestions (e.g., common commands via LLM?); multi-line for complex inputs; validation (non-empty).
Status Bar: Top bar showing char name, HP, current room; update on events.
Controls: Buttons for theme toggle, copy log, quit/session save.



2.2 User Flow

Launch: Show char select.
Select Char: Engine initializes session; switch to main screen with initial room desc.
Play: Input command → Send to engine → Engine processes (LLM parse/resolve) → Output to log → Update status.
History: Log persists across app restarts via engine's memory module.
End: Quit button saves state, exits.

2.3 UX Design

Immersive: Fantasy theme—parchment background, glowing text effects via Compose modifiers.
Accessibility: High contrast modes; keyboard nav (focus input on launch).
Responsiveness: Handle long narratives (pagination?); loading indicators for LLM delays.
Error Handling: Display engine errors in log (e.g., "Invalid action—try again."); graceful offline (if LLM fails).
Nice Touches: Emoji/icons in log (e.g., ⚔️ for combat); sound cues (optional, via Compose extensions); undo last input.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Performance: Smooth scrolling for 1000+ log entries; async LLM calls.
Scalability: Multiplatform—desktop MVP, easy Android/iOS add.
Reliability: State persistence; crash recovery (autosave log).
Cost: No new LLM calls for UI—reuse engine's.
Simplicity: Single ViewModel; no deep composables.

4. Architecture Outline

Modules:

Perception: Input field events → Engine send.
Reasoning: ViewModel processes engine outputs → Update UI state.
Action: Render log/status via Composables.
Memory: Tie to engine's vector DB for log history.


Data Flow: ViewModel exposes StateFlow<UiState>; UI observes, renders immutably.
Integration Changes: Engine adds event emitter (e.g., Flow<GameEvent>); UI subscribes.

5. Testing Requirements

Focus: UI behaviors (e.g., log appends on output; input submits).
Types:

Unit: Composables with mocks.
Integration: Mock engine for full flows (char select → play).
Property-Based: Varied inputs/outputs.
E2E: Simulated session with variability checks.


Fixtures: Deterministic engine mocks.

6. Next Steps

Prototype UI: Basic Compose app with mocked engine.
Integrate: Hook to real engine, test flows.
This should feel polished—let's mock a session to verify UX.
