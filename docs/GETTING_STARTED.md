# Getting Started

Quick start guide for developers and players.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Gradle (wrapper included)
- OpenAI API key (optional - game works without it in fallback mode)

### API Key Configuration
Add your OpenAI API key using one of these methods:

**Option 1: local.properties** (recommended)
```properties
openai.api.key=sk-your-key-here
```

**Option 2: Environment variable**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here
```

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the entire project
gradle build

# Run all tests
gradle test

# Clean build outputs
gradle clean

# Build and run the game
gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app

# Build just the app module
gradle :app:build
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run tests for specific modules
gradle :core:test
gradle :reasoning:test
gradle :memory:test
gradle :app:test

# Run the automated test bot (requires OpenAI API key)
gradle :testbot:run
```

Test logs are saved to `test-logs/` directory (JSON + human-readable text).

## Running the Game

1. **Start the game**:
   ```bash
   gradle installDist && app/build/install/app/bin/app
   ```

2. **Choose game mode**:
   - **Single-player mode** - Traditional single-player experience with save/load support
   - **Multi-user mode (local)** - Uses GameServer architecture (network support coming soon)

3. **Select dungeon type**:
   - Sample Dungeon (handcrafted, 6 rooms)
   - Procedural Crypt (ancient tombs)
   - Procedural Castle (ruined fortress)
   - Procedural Cave (dark caverns)
   - Procedural Temple (forgotten shrine)
   - Specify room count for procedural dungeons (default: 10)

## Gameplay Features

### Dungeon Types
- **Sample dungeon**: 6 handcrafted rooms with items (weapons, armor, potions, gold) and NPCs (Old Guard, Skeleton King)
- **Procedural dungeons**: Dynamically generated with theme-appropriate traits, random NPCs, and distributed loot

### LLM Features (with API key)
- **Room descriptions**: Dynamically generated using gpt-4o-mini with RAG context
- **NPC dialogue**: Personality-driven (friendly vs hostile, health-aware) with conversation history
- **Combat narratives**: Visceral, atmospheric descriptions that build on previous rounds
- **Embeddings**: via text-embedding-3-small for semantic memory retrieval

### Game Mechanics

**Item System**
- Pick up items with `take`
- Drop items with `drop`
- Equip weapons to increase damage
- Equip armor to reduce damage taken
- Use consumables (potions) to restore health

**NPC Interaction**
- Talk to NPCs with `talk` command
- Get contextual, personality-driven responses
- Responses reference past conversations (RAG memory)

**Combat System**
- Turn-based combat with health tracking
- Weapon damage bonuses (e.g., iron sword +5)
- Armor defense bonuses (e.g., chainmail +4)
- Victory and defeat conditions
- LLM-narrated combat events

**Skill System**
- D&D-style stats: STR, DEX, CON, INT, WIS, CHA
- d20 + modifier vs Difficulty Class
- Critical successes (nat 20) and failures (nat 1)
- Sample dungeon has 4 interactive challenges:
  - Loose stone (WIS/DC10) - Find hidden items
  - Locked chest (DEX/DC15) - Pick locks
  - Stuck door (STR/DC20) - Force open
  - Arcane runes (INT/DC15) - Decipher magic

**Social System**
- Express emotions through emotes (smile, wave, nod, shrug, laugh, cry, bow)
- Ask NPCs questions to learn about topics
- Build relationships through disposition system (-100 to +100)
- Disposition affects dialogue tone and NPC behavior
- Quest completion grants +15 disposition with quest giver
- Persuade NPCs (CHA check) to reveal information
- Intimidate NPCs (CHA check) to avoid combat
- All interactions and knowledge persist in database
- See [Social System Documentation](./SOCIAL_SYSTEM.md) for details

**Quest System**
- Procedurally generated quests based on dungeon
- 6 objective types: Kill, Collect, Explore, Talk, UseSkill, Deliver
- Rewards: Experience points, gold, items
- Track progress in quest log
- Claim rewards upon completion

**RAG Memory**
- All game events stored with embeddings
- Retrieved contextually for LLM prompts
- Makes descriptions and dialogue more immersive
- Remembers your actions and decisions

**Procedural Generation**
- Create dungeons of any size
- 4 themes with unique traits
- NPCs with varied stats and personalities
- Distributed loot (weapons, armor, consumables, gold)

**Persistence**
- Save and load game state to/from JSON files
- Preserves all state: player stats, inventory, equipment, combat, world
- Multiple save slots supported
- Saves stored in `saves/` directory

**Multi-User Mode**
- Server-based architecture
- Multiple players in shared world
- Per-player combat state
- Event broadcasting for player visibility
- Thread-safe state management
- Ready for network layer (coming soon)

## Troubleshooting

### No API Key
Game works without an API key! You'll get simpler descriptions instead of LLM-generated ones.

### Build Errors
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
gradle clean build

# Check Java version
java -version  # Should be 17 or higher
```

### Save/Load Issues
Save files are in `saves/` directory as human-readable JSON. You can inspect or manually edit them if needed.

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with the basics:
1. Try different dungeon themes and sizes
2. Experiment with skill checks (you'll need high stats for harder checks)
3. Complete quests for XP and gold
4. Test the multi-user mode (great for testing multi-player features)
5. Check out the test bot to see autonomous gameplay
