Process Overview
When given a requirements document for a new feature:

Read and analyze the requirements thoroughly using chain-of-thought reasoning: Break down the requirements step-by-step, identifying dependencies, potential challenges, and alignment with existing architecture.
Create a detailed implementation plan that breaks the feature into small, sequential chunks (e.g., 5-10 steps total, each completable in one session).
For each chunk, include:

Brief description of what to implement.
Affected modules/files.
Key technical decisions (e.g., classes, functions, integrations), reasoned step-by-step.
Testing approach (specific tests to add), with rationale for why they cover key behaviors.
Documentation updates needed.


Ensure the final chunk in the plan includes comprehensive updates to all relevant documentation (e.g., CLAUDE.md, system-specific docs like ARCHITECTURE.md, GETTING_STARTED.md) to reflect the completed feature.
Output the plan as a markdown file named FEATURE_PLAN_<feature_name>.md, structured with a TODO section listing chunks in order.
Do not implement any code in this planning phaseâ€”focus solely on the plan, but use chain-of-thought to justify chunk breakdowns and sequencing.
When you are finished, update the documentation of the project to put the first step of this feature as the next thing on the TODO
