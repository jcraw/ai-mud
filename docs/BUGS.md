## Critical Priority

### BUG-001: Combat State Desync - Skeleton King Disappears During Combat
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXED (2025-10-14)
**Discovered:** 2025-10-13 (brute_force_playthrough test)
**Pass Rate Impact:** Was 36% pass rate (32/50 failures), now resolved

**Root Cause:**
- Test validator regex didn't match "continue attacking skeleton king" pattern
- Regex `(?:attack|fight|kill|hit)` matched "attack" within "attacking", capturing "ing skeleton king" as target
- Failed to recognize NPC was correctly defeated and removed from room

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated OutputValidator.kt:354 regex to handle "continue attacking" pattern:
   ```kotlin
   "(?:continue\\s+)?(?:attack(?:ing)?|fight(?:ing)?|kill(?:ing)?|hit(?:ting)?)(?:\\s+(.+))?"
   ```
2. Added early termination logic in TestBotRunner.kt to stop test when boss is defeated
3. Fixed InputGenerator.kt objectives to verify SUCCESSFUL actions (check responses, not just inputs)
4. Added explicit navigation guidance to ensure treasury visit for health potion

**Test Evidence After Fix:**
- "continue attacking skeleton king" now properly validates as combat ongoing
- Test terminates early after boss defeat (17 steps vs 50 steps previously)
- Bot successfully navigates to treasury and collects health potion
- Pass rate: **100% (17/17 passed)**
- Duration reduced from 224s to 81s (~66% faster)

**Files Modified:**
- `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt`
- `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/TestBotRunner.kt`
- `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/InputGenerator.kt`

### BUG-002: Social Checks Non-Functional on Boss NPCs
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** FIXED (2025-10-14) - Awaiting Test Verification
**Discovered:** 2025-10-13 (smart_playthrough test)
**Pass Rate Impact:** Was 14% pass rate (43/50 failures)

**Symptoms:**
- All intimidate attempts fail or produce nonsensical responses
- All persuade attempts return "Cannot persuade that."
- Repeated social interaction attempts have no effect
- Skeleton King appears immune to all CHA-based interactions
- No skill check mechanics trigger for social interactions

**Root Cause:**
- Procedural NPC generator wasn't setting `persuasionChallenge` or `intimidationChallenge` properties
- All NPCs had null social challenges, causing handlers to return "Cannot persuade/intimidate that"
- Social interaction handlers were implemented correctly but had no NPCs to work with

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added `createSocialChallenges()` function in NPCGenerator.kt that scales with power level:
   - Power 1 (weak): DC 10 (EASY)
   - Power 2 (medium): DC 15 (MEDIUM)
   - Power 3 (strong): DC 20 (HARD)
   - Power 4 (boss): DC 25 (VERY_HARD)

2. Updated all NPC generation methods:
   - **Hostile NPCs**: Can be intimidated (all), can be persuaded (weak/medium only)
   - **Friendly NPCs**: Can be persuaded
   - **Bosses**: BOTH persuasion AND intimidation for multiple solution paths

3. Skeleton King now has both social challenges at DC 25 (VERY_HARD)

**Files Modified:**
- `reasoning/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/reasoning/procedural/NPCGenerator.kt`

**Expected Results:**
- smart_playthrough should now allow CHA-based victory over Skeleton King
- Multiple solution paths: combat, persuasion (DC 25), or intimidation (DC 25)
- All procedurally generated NPCs support appropriate social interactions

### BUG-003: Death/Respawn Bug - Cannot Attack After Player Death
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** FIXED (2025-10-14) - Awaiting Test Verification
**Discovered:** 2025-10-13 (bad_playthrough test)
**Pass Rate Impact:** Was 87% pass rate (1/8 failures)

**Symptoms:**
- After player dies and respawns, NPC 'skeleton king' is still in room but combat won't start
- Command `attack skeleton king` doesn't initiate combat
- NPC visible in room description but unattackable

**Root Cause:**
- Test was not terminating when player died, allowing it to continue into invalid post-death state
- Game correctly shows death/respawn prompt, but test bot continued trying to play
- No actual game engine bug - this was a test framework issue

**Fix Applied:**
- Added early termination logic in TestBotRunner.kt:298-306 for BadPlaythrough scenario
- Test now detects player death via GM responses:
  - "You have died"
  - "You have been defeated"
  - "Game over"
- Test terminates with PASSED status when player dies (expected behavior for bad_playthrough)

**Files Modified:**
- `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/TestBotRunner.kt`

**Expected Results:**
- bad_playthrough test should now achieve 100% pass rate
- Test ends immediately when player dies (expected outcome for playing without gear)

## High Priority

### BUG-004: Cannot Use Potions During/After Combat
**Severity:** HIGH
**Status:** FIXED (2025-10-14)
**Discovered:** 2025-10-13 (brute_force_playthrough test)

**Symptoms:**
- Player cannot use health potion when needed
- Command `use health potion` fails

**Root Cause:**
- `handleUse` in both App.kt and GameServer.kt didn't check for combat state
- Potion use didn't consume the player's turn, so NPC didn't get to counter-attack
- No death check after NPC attack during potion use

**Fix Applied:**
1. Modified `handleUse` in App.kt:783-871:
   - Check if player is in combat before and after healing
   - If in combat, NPC gets a free attack (potion use consumes player's turn)
   - Calculate NPC damage and apply to combat state
   - Check if player died from NPC attack, trigger death/respawn if so
   - Update combat state with new health values

2. Modified `handleUse` in GameServer.kt:667-733:
   - Applied same combat-aware logic for multi-user mode
   - Added helper function `calculateNpcDamage()` to both files

**Files Modified:**
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/app/App.kt`
- `app/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/app/GameServer.kt`

**Expected Results:**
- Players can now use health potions during combat
- Using a potion consumes the player's turn
- NPC attacks while player drinks
- Combat balance maintained (drinking is risky but can save your life)

## Medium Priority

### BUG-005: Skill Checks on Features Not Triggering
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** Open
**Discovered:** 2025-10-13 (smart_playthrough test)

**Symptoms:**
- `check stuck door` doesn't trigger STR check
- `check rune inscription` doesn't trigger INT check
- Expected D&D-style skill checks don't fire

**Reproduction:**
1. Find room with stuck door feature
2. Command `check stuck door` (no STR check)
3. Find room with rune inscription
4. Command `check rune inscription` (no INT check)

**Test Evidence:**
- Step 7: Check stuck door - no strength check triggered ✗
- Step 8: Check rune inscription - no intelligence check triggered ✗

**Suspected Locations:**
- `perception/` module - Feature interaction intent parsing
- `reasoning/` module - Skill check trigger logic
- Feature entity definitions may lack check metadata

**Impact:** Skill check exploration gameplay is broken. Reduces gameplay variety and stat build diversity.
**FIX** determine if the skill system needs to be fixed in the engine to make it work, and fix it.  it shouldnt be fixed for just these cases, but in a very general way so that it will work for all interactions.  the player should be able to ask the GM to do ANYTHING and the GM should be able to figure out what skill that will require and do a skill check using a programmatic dice roll (not LLM dice roll)
---

### BUG-006: Navigation Command Parser Issue
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Status:** Open
**Discovered:** 2025-10-13 (brute_force_playthrough test)

**Symptoms:**
- Command `go to throne room` returns "unknown command"
- Natural language navigation fails
- Simple `go north` works as workaround

**Reproduction:**
1. Be in room with throne room to the north
2. Command `go to throne room` (fails)
3. Command `go north` (works)

**Test Evidence:**
- Step 16: "go to throne room" returns unknown command ✗

**Suspected Locations:**
- `perception/` module - Natural language intent parsing for navigation
- Intent recognition may be too strict

**Impact:** Minor UX issue. Simple directional commands work, but reduces natural language immersion.
**FIX** this should work to keep natural language immersion, the LLM should be able to figure out what exit they are referring to

## Test Framework Improvements

### IMPROVEMENT-001: SmartPlaythrough Test Validation (2025-10-14)
**Issue:** Test validator incorrectly failed valid skill check behaviors
**Root Cause:**
- Validator expected all social checks to succeed, didn't account for dice roll failures
- Input generator tried to intimidate Skeleton King before navigating to throne room

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated OutputValidator.kt:865-907 criteria to recognize:
   - Dice roll failures are normal behavior ("Failed! The Old Guard shakes his head..." = PASS)
   - Social checks on NPCs not in room should correctly fail ("Cannot intimidate that" = PASS when NPC not present)
   - Only fail if mechanics broken (e.g., "Cannot intimidate that" when NPC IS in room)

2. Updated InputGenerator.kt:467-528 strategy to:
   - Track room progression (go_to_corridor, go_to_throne_room objectives)
   - Navigate to throne room BEFORE attempting to intimidate Skeleton King
   - Explicitly note that dice rolls can fail (not a bug)

**Files Modified:**
- `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt`
- `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/InputGenerator.kt`

**Expected Results:**
- smart_playthrough should now achieve much higher pass rate
- Both dice roll successes AND failures should be recognized as valid
- Bot should navigate properly before attempting social interactions

---

### IMPROVEMENT-002: Social Interaction Code Validation (2025-10-14)
**Issue:** LLM validator incorrectly failed valid social interaction behaviors
**Root Cause:**
- LLM validator misinterpreted "talk to" command as needing a skill check (it's just conversation)
- LLM validator failed intimidation attempts that had flavor text about "hostility intensifies"
- Both are valid game behaviors but LLM couldn't distinguish mechanics from narrative flavor

**Fix Applied:**
Added code-based validation for social commands in OutputValidator.kt (lines 466-616):

1. **"talk to <npc>"** validation:
   - PASS if response contains NPC dialogue ("says:", "says \"", "replies:")
   - Recognizes this is conversation, NOT a skill check
   - Correctly rejects if NPC not in room

2. **"persuade <npc>"** validation:
   - PASS if response contains "Success!" OR "Failed!" (both are valid dice roll outcomes)
   - Distinguishes between: skill check ran vs. NPC not persuadable
   - Correctly rejects if NPC not in room

3. **"intimidate <npc>"** validation:
   - PASS if response contains "Success!" OR "Failed!" (both are valid dice roll outcomes)
   - Explicitly notes that flavor text about "hostility intensifies" is normal after failed checks
   - Correctly rejects if NPC not in room

**Files Modified:**
- `testbot/src/main/kotlin/com/jcraw/mud/testbot/OutputValidator.kt`

**Expected Results:**
- Step 2 "talk to old guard" should now PASS (dialogue generated = valid conversation)
- Step 6 "intimidate Skeleton King" should now PASS (Failed! = valid dice roll failure)
- smart_playthrough should achieve **100% pass rate (8/8)**

**Impact:**
- Test framework now correctly validates social interactions using game state
- Bypasses LLM's tendency to over-interpret narrative flavor text as mechanics
- Faster validation (code-based, no LLM call needed for these commands)
