Roleplaying Engine MVP Requirements (MUD-Inspired Update)
Got it—you're envisioning an LLM-boosted MUD: text-based, room-to-room exploration, but with dynamic, variable descriptions regenerated by the LLM each time (based on fixed room traits). Combat and interactions get richer narratives. No static text dumps—everything feels fresh and adaptive. This fits the previous specs but shifts emphasis to MUD mechanics over pure D&D abstraction. For MVP, keep it single-player console, natural language inputs, LLM for parsing/generation. Scale to multi-user/Discord by abstracting I/O.
Updating the doc to integrate this. Rules still abstracted (sealed classes), RAG for history/context. Keep simple: no overkill abstractions.
1. Overview (Updated)

System Purpose: AI-powered MUD engine. Player navigates rooms via text commands (natural language), gets LLM-generated descriptions that vary on each "look" (pulling from room's core attributes). Handles exploration, skills, combat with enhanced LLM narratives. Single-player MVP, console I/O.
Key MUD Elements:

World as graph of rooms: Each with fixed traits (e.g., "dark forest, hidden trap, goblin enemy") stored in state.
Dynamic Output: LLM generates unique description/narration each interaction, using traits + history (via RAG) for variety/coherence.
Natural Inputs: "Go north" or "Look around" parsed by LLM—no rigid syntax.
Enhanced Features: Combat descriptions vivid (e.g., "Your sword clashes with the goblin's shield in a spray of sparks"); skills/exploration adaptive.


Tech Stack: Unchanged. Use coroutines for potential async; immutable state for world/player.

2. Functional Requirements (Updated for MUD)
2.1 User Interactions

Player:

Natural text: e.g., "Move to the east room." or "Examine the chest." or "Attack the monster."
"Look" command (or equivalent) triggers fresh LLM description.


System (Narrator/DM):

Parse input via LLM: Detect intent (move, look, interact, fight).
Ignore non-addressed chit-chat (as before).
Generate responses: Always via LLM for variability—prompt includes room traits, player state, history.


Session Bootstrap: Start with char select, then drop into starting room.

2.2 Game Flow (MUD-Style)

World Structure:

Rooms: Modeled as data classes with traits (e.g., data class Room(id: String, traits: List<String>, exits: Map<Direction, RoomId>, contents: List<Entity>)).
Premade Map: Simple dungeon (e.g., 5-10 rooms) for MVP—graph structure, no proc-gen yet.


Exploration:

Move: Parse direction/intent → Update position → Narrate entry with fresh LLM desc.
Look: Regenerate description using traits (e.g., prompt: "Describe a [traits] room variably, based on prior [RAG context].").
Variability: LLM ensures different phrasing each time (e.g., weather changes subtly, details shift for immersion).


Skills/Interactions:

e.g., "Search for secrets" → LLM interprets as skill check → Code rolls dice → LLM narrates outcome uniquely.
Traps/Objects: Fixed in room traits; LLM handles discovery/description dynamically.


Combat:

Initiative: Simple turn-based—player acts, system resolves enemy AI via LLM (e.g., "Decide goblin's action based on state.").
Enhanced Descriptions: LLM generates vivid blow-by-blow (e.g., "The goblin lunges, but you dodge—your counterstrike lands true.").
Resolution: Abstracted rules (sealed class for outcomes: Success, Fail, Critical).


Core Loop:

Console: "What do you do?" → Input → Classify/Parse → Resolve → Fresh Narrate → Repeat.
Use ReAct for complex decisions: Observe (state + input), Reason (LLM), Act (update/narrate).



2.3 Console I/O

Unchanged: Pluggable handler for future Discord.
Output: Text narratives, no visuals.

3. Non-Functional Requirements

Variability: LLM prompts engineered for non-deterministic output (e.g., "Vary wording creatively while staying true to traits.").
Coherence: RAG pulls past descriptions/actions to avoid contradictions.
Scalability: Room graph extensible; add multi-user by tracking per-player positions in shared world.
Simplicity: Traits as strings/lists—no deep ontologies yet.

4. Architecture Outline (Updated)

Modules:

Perception: Input + LLM parser (intents like Move, Look, Attack).
Reasoning: LLM for generation/resolution (prompts include traits, RAG).
Action: Output narrator.
Memory: Vector DB for history; structured state for world (rooms, player pos/char).


Data Flow: Immutable WorldState(rooms: Map<RoomId, Room>, player: PlayerState).
LLM Prompts: e.g., For look: "Generate a unique description for room with traits [list], incorporating [RAG history]. Keep engaging."

5. Testing Requirements

Behavior: Test variability (mock LLM returns different descs); boundaries (invalid moves).
Integration: Mock sequence: Enter room → Look twice → Different outputs.
Property-Based: Random inputs parse correctly.

6. Next Steps

Prototype a simple room graph with LLM mocks.
Run a test session: See if descriptions feel "next-level" without repeating.
This should capture the MUD essence—let's iterate if needed.
